Factors 
 Many statements contained in this Report are forward-looking in nature. These statements are based on
our current plans, intentions or expectations, and actual results could differ materially as we cannot guarantee that we will achieve these plans, intentions or expectations. See  Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those specifically identified below. The Company cautions you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of
the date hereof. Additional factors not presently known to the Company, or that the Company does not currently believe to be material, may also cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Except as may be required by law, the
Company undertakes no obligation to update or alter these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 Our results of operations have been,
and could continue to be, adversely affected by the past recession experienced by the U.S. economy and in many of the local economies in which we operate. 
 Revenue generated by our radio stations depends primarily upon the sale of advertising. Advertising expenditures, which we believe to be largely a discretionary business expense, declined significantly
during the 2008 economic recession, and have been muted since, partially in light of continued economic uncertainty. Furthermore, because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from local advertisers, our ability to generate advertising
revenue in specific markets is directly affected by local or regional economic conditions, many of which have not returned to pre-recessionary levels. Consequently, the continued uncertainty in the general economic environment, including the
economies of several individual geographic markets in which we own or operate stations, continue to adversely affect our advertising revenue and, therefore, our results of operations. 
 In light of the limited and ongoing recovery from the recession, certain individual business sectors that may have historically spent
more on advertising than other sectors might be forced to reduce their advertising expenditures or not return them to pre-recessionary levels if that sector fails to recover on pace with the overall economy. If that sectors spending would
otherwise have represented a significant portion of our advertising revenues, any reduction in its expenditures may adversely affect our revenue. 
 We operate in a very competitive business environment and a decrease in our ratings or market share would adversely affect our revenues. 
 The radio broadcasting industry is very competitive. The success of each of our stations depends largely upon rates it can charge for its
advertising which in turn depends on, among other things, the number of local advertising competitors and the overall demand for advertising within individual markets. These conditions are subject to change and highly susceptible to both micro and
macroeconomic conditions. 
 Index to Financial Statements 
 Audience ratings and market shares fluctuate, and any adverse change in a particular market
could have a material adverse effect on the revenue of stations located in that market. While we already compete with other stations with comparable programming formats in many of our markets, any one of our stations could suffer a reduction in
ratings or revenue and could require increased promotion and other expenses, and, consequently, could reduce operating results, if: 
 another radio station in the market was to convert its programming format to a format similar to our station or launch aggressive promotional
campaigns; 
 a new station were to adopt a competitive format; 
 we experience increased competition from non-radio sources; 
 there is a shift in population, demographics, audience tastes or other factors beyond our control; 
 an existing competitor was to strengthen its operations; or 
 any one or all of our stations will be able to maintain or increase advertising revenue market share. 
 The Telecom Act may allow for the further consolidation of ownership of radio broadcasting stations in markets in which we operate or may
operate in the future. Some competing owners may be larger and have substantially more financial and other resources than we do. There can be no assurance that any one or all of our stations will be able to maintain or increase advertising revenue
market share. 
 The loss of affiliation agreements by our radio networks could materially adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations. 
 Our radio networks have approximately 5,000 station affiliates and 9,000 program
affiliations. They receive advertising inventory from their affiliated stations, either in the form of stand-alone advertising time within a specified time period or commercials inserted by our radio networks into their programming. In addition,
primarily with respect to satellite radio providers, we receive a fee for providing such programming. The loss of network affiliation agreements by our radio networks could adversely affect our results of operations by reducing the reach of our
network programming and, therefore, their attractiveness to advertisers. Renewals of such agreements on less favorable terms may also adversely affect our results of operations through reduction of advertising revenue. 
 We must respond to the rapid changes in technology, services and standards that characterize our industry in order to remain
competitive. 
 The radio broadcasting industry is subject to technological change, evolving industry standards and the
emergence of new media technologies and services. In some cases, our ability to successfully compete will be dependent on our development and acquisition of new technologies and our provision of new services, and there can be no assurance that we
will have the resources to develop or acquire those new technologies or provide those new services; in other cases, the introduction of new technologies and services, including online music and other entertainment services, could increase
competition and have an adverse effect on our revenue. Recent new media technologies and services include the following: 
 audio programming by cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite systems, internet content providers (both landline and wireless),
internet-based audio radio services, smart phone and other mobile applications, satellite delivered digital audio radio service and other digital audio broadcast formats; 
 HD Radio 
 digital radio, which could provide multi-channel, multi-format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional AM and FM radio services. 
 Index to Financial Statements 
 In the future, there may be additional technologies or services developed that compete with
radio broadcasting or for advertising revenue, and that could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. We also cannot provide any assurances that we will continue to have the resources to develop or acquire any
necessary new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with any new technologies. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that competition arising from new technologies may have on the radio broadcasting industry or on our
business. 
 We have written off, and could in the future be required to write off, a significant portion of the fair
market value of our FCC broadcast licenses and goodwill, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 As of December 31, 2012, our FCC licenses and goodwill comprised 74.7% of our assets. Each year, and more frequently on an interim basis if appropriate, we are required by Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 350 
 (ASC 350), to assess the fair market value of our FCC broadcast licenses and goodwill to determine whether the carrying value of those assets is impaired. For the year
ended December 31, 2012, we recorded impairment charges of $104.0 million and $14.7 million related to goodwill and FCC broadcast licenses, respectively, and a definite-lived intangible asset impairment of $12.4 million related to the
cancellation of a contract. There were no similar impairments in 2011. During the year ended December 31, 2010 we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $0.7 million in order to reduce the carrying value of certain broadcast licenses
and goodwill to their respective fair market values. Future impairment reviews could result in additional impairment charges. Any such impairment charges would reduce our reported earnings for the periods in which they are recorded, which could
materially reduce the value of our Company. 
 , Intangibles  Goodwill and Other 
 There are risks associated with our acquisition strategy. 
 We intend to continue to grow by selectively acquiring radio station clusters and individual radio stations in the
future. We cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing any acquisitions or what the consequences of these acquisitions would be. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates.
Consummation of any acquisitions would likely be subject to various conditions, such as compliance with FCC and antitrust regulatory requirements. The FCC requirements include: 
 approval of license assignments and transfers; 
 limits on the number of stations a broadcaster may own in a given local market; and 
 other rules or policies, such as the ownership attribution rules, that could limit our ability to acquire stations in certain markets where one or more
of our stockholders, officers or directors has other media interests. 
 The antitrust regulatory requirements
include: 
 filings with the DOJ and the FTC under the HSR Act, where applicable; 
 expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act; and 
 possible review by the DOJ or the FTC of antitrust issues under the HSR Act or otherwise. 
 We cannot be certain that any of these conditions will be satisfied, the timing thereof or the potential impact that any such conditions
may have on us. In addition, the FCC has in the past asserted the authority to review levels of local radio market concentration as part of its acquisition approval process, even where proposed assignments would comply with the numerical limits on
local radio station ownership in the FCCs rules and the Communications Act. 
 Our acquisition strategy involves numerous
other risks, including risks associated with: 
 identifying suitable acquisition candidates and negotiating definitive purchase agreements on satisfactory terms; 
 Index to Financial Statements 
 integrating operations and systems and managing a large and geographically diverse group of stations; 
 diverting our managements attention from other business concerns; 
 potentially losing key employees at acquired stations; and 
 potential changes in the regulatory approval process that may make it materially more expensive, or materially delay our ability, to consummate any
proposed acquisitions. 
 We cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquisitions
or manage the resulting business effectively, or that any acquisition will achieve the benefits that we anticipate. In addition, we are not certain that we will be able to acquire properties at valuations as favorable as those of previous
acquisitions. Depending upon the nature, size and timing of potential future acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional financing in order to consummate additional acquisitions. We cannot assure you that our debt agreements, as may be in
place at any time, will permit us to consummate an acquisition or access the necessary additional financing because of certain covenant restrictions or that additional financing will be available to us or, if available, that financing would be on
terms acceptable to our management. 
 We are required to obtain prior Federal approval for any proposed radio station
acquisition, which approvals may be subject to our compliance with certain conditions, possibly including asset divestitures, which may be material. 
 Acquisitions historically have been, a critical component of our overall strategy. The acquisition of a radio station requires the prior approval of the FCC and may require approvals by other governmental
agencies, such as the DOJ or the FTC. To obtain that approval, a proposed acquirer is required to file a transfer of control or assignment application with the FCC. The Communications Act and FCC rules allow members of the public and other
interested parties to file petitions seeking to deny, or other objections to the FCC with respect to, the grant of any transfer or assignment application. The FCC could rely on those objections or its own initiative to deny a transfer or assignment
application or to require changes in the transaction, including the divestiture of radio stations and other assets that we already own or propose to acquire, as a condition to having the application granted. The FCC could also change its existing
rules and policies to reduce the number of stations that we would be permitted to acquire in some markets. For these and other reasons, there can be no assurance that the FCC will approve potential future acquisitions that we deem material to our
business. Any actions by the FCC or DOJ that have the effect of denying, delaying or affecting the terms of any potential acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could restrict our ability to access further financing. 
 We may rely in significant part on the capital and credit markets to meet our financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs if
internal funds from operations are not sufficient for these purposes. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets, such as have been experienced over the past several years, could adversely affect our ability to draw on our credit facilities or
access capital. Access to funds under credit facilities is dependent on the ability of our lenders to meet their funding commitments. Those lenders may not be able or willing to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital
and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from their borrowers within a short period of time. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets have also resulted in increased costs associated with bank credit
facilities. Continued disruptions could increase our interest expense and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Longer
term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions, could adversely affect our access to financing. Any such
disruption could increase our costs, require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding could be arranged. Such measures could include seeking higher cost financings,
deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future uses of cash, any of which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 Index to Financial Statements 
 We are exposed to credit risk on our accounts receivable. This risk is heightened
during periods of worsened economic conditions. 
 Our outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or
credit insurance. While we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on our receivables, which risk is heightened during periods of worsened economic conditions, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our
credit risk and enable us to avoid losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. 
 Counterparties to derivative transactions we enter into may not be able to perform their obligations under such transactions. 
 Although we evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements from time to
time with those deemed to have minimal credit risk at the time the agreements are executed, there can be no assurances that such counterparties will be able to perform their obligations under the relevant agreements. If our counterparties fail to
perform their obligations, we may not be able to receive the expected benefits from such derivative transactions, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We are dependent on key personnel. 
 Our business is managed by a small number of key management and operating personnel, and our loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that
our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel and to expand, train and manage our employee base. Although we have entered into employment agreements with some of our key
management personnel that include provisions restricting their ability to compete with us under specified circumstances, we cannot assure you that all of those restrictions would be enforced if challenged in court. 
 We also enter into agreements with several on-air personalities with large loyal audiences in their individual markets to protect our
interests in those relationships that we believe to be valuable. The loss of one or more of these personalities could result in losses of audience share in that particular market which, in turn, could adversely affect revenues in that particular
market. 
 The broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing Federal regulation. 
 The radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the FCC under the Communications Act. We are required to obtain
licenses from the FCC to operate our stations. Licenses are normally granted for a term of eight years and are renewable. Although the vast majority of FCC radio station licenses are routinely renewed, we cannot assure you that the FCC will grant
our existing or future renewal applications or that the renewals will not include conditions out of the ordinary course of our operations. The non-renewal, or renewal with conditions, of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse
effect on us. 
 We must also comply with the extensive FCC regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of our radio
stations. FCC regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market, which could restrict our ability to acquire radio stations that could be material to our overall financial performance or our financial performance in
a particular market. 
 The FCC also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to limit interference
between two or more radio stations. Despite those limitations, a dispute could arise whether another station is improperly interfering with the operation of one of our stations or another radio licensee could complain to the FCC that one our
stations is improperly interfering with that licensees station. There can be no assurance as to how the FCC might resolve that dispute. These FCC regulations and others may change over time, and we cannot assure you that those changes would
not have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Index to Financial Statements 
 The FCC has been vigorous in its enforcement of its indecency rules against the
broadcast industry, a violation of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 FCC regulations
prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time, and indecent material between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. The FCC regulatory oversight is augmented by statutory authority for the FCC to impose
substantial penalties (up to $325,000 for each violation). The FCC also has the statutory authority to revoke a station license or to shorten or condition the renewal of a station license in the event that the station broadcasts indecent or obscene
material. In June 2012, the United States Supreme Court issued a decision which held that the FCC had failed to give broadcasters adequate notice of a change in FCC policy in 2004 that exposed a station owner to penalties because of broadcasts which
included fleeting expletives or momentary nudity (in a television broadcast). The FCC has not issued any pronouncement or other comment on the Supreme Courts decision, and it is therefore unclear whether the Supreme Courts decision will
have any significance for programs aired on radio or television after the change in FCC policy was announced in 2004. In the meantime, for many years the FCC has refrained from processing and disposing of hundreds of thousands of indecency
complaints because of the uncertainty concerning the validity of prior FCC rulings. It is impossible to predict what, if any, impact the Supreme Courts decision will have on any complaints that have been or may be filed against our stations.
Whatever the impact, we may in the future become subject to new FCC inquiries or proceedings related to our stations broadcast of allegedly indecent or obscene material. To the extent that such an inquiry or proceeding results in the
imposition of fines, a settlement with the FCC, revocation of any of our station licenses or denials of license renewal applications, our results of operation and business could be materially adversely affected. 
 Proposed legislation requires radio broadcasters to pay royalties to record labels and recording artists. 
 We currently pay royalties to song composers and publishers through Broadcast Music Inc., the American Society of Composers, Authors and
Publishers and SESAC, Inc. but not to record labels or recording artists for exhibition or use of over the air broadcasts of music. Congress has been considering legislation which would change the copyright fees and the procedures by which the fees
are determined. The legislation has been the subject of considerable debate and activity by the broadcast industry and other parties affected by the legislation. It cannot be predicted whether any proposed legislation will become law or what impact
it would have on our results from operations, cash flows or financial position. 
 We are a holding company with no
material independent assets or operations and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash. 
 We are a holding company with no
material independent assets or operations, other than our investments in our subsidiaries. Because we are a holding company, we are dependent upon the payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries to fund our
obligations. These payments could be subject to restrictions on dividends or other payment restrictions under applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. Payments by our subsidiaries are also contingent upon the
subsidiaries earnings. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our financial condition and ability to meet our obligations may be adversely affected. 
 Risks Related to Our Indebtedness 
 The level of our outstanding debt may make it more difficult to comply with the covenants in our debt instruments, including the financial covenants in our First Lien Facility (as defined below),
which could cause a default or an event of default under such debt instruments and could result in the loss of our sources of liquidity, acceleration of our indebtedness and, in some instances, the foreclosure on some or all of our assets, any of
which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 The instruments
governing our outstanding indebtedness contain restrictive covenants. In addition, our First Lien Credit Agreement, dated as of September 16, 2011, among the Company, Cumulus Holdings, as Borrower, certain lenders, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as
Administrative Agent (JPMorgan), UBS, Macquarie, Royal 
 Index to Financial Statements 
 Bank of Canada and ING Capital LLC, as Co-Syndication Agents, and U.S. Bank National Association and Fifth Third Bank, as Co-Documentation Agents, (as amended and restated, the First Lien
Facility) requires us to comply with a financial covenant if any amounts are outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility ( the Revolving Credit Facility) or any letters of credit are outstanding that have not been
collateralized by cash. As of December 31, 2012, we had no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, and, as result, were not subject to the financial covenant. Our ability to comply with the covenants in the (i) indenture
governing our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2019 (the Indenture), (ii) First Lien Facility and (iii) Second Lien Credit Agreement (the Second Lien Facility and, together with the First Lien Facility, the 2011 Credit
Facilities), dated as of September 16, 2011, among the Company, Cumulus Holdings, as Borrower, certain lenders, JPMorgan, as Administrative Agent, and UBS, Macquarie, Royal Bank of Canada and ING Capital LLC, as Co-Syndication Agents,
will depend upon our future performance and various other factors, such as business, competitive, technological, legislative and regulatory factors, some of which are beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain compliance with all of our
covenants in the future. In that event, we would need to seek an amendment or waiver to the applicable agreement, or a refinancing of such obligations. There can be no assurance that we would be able obtain any amendment or waiver of any such
facilities or the costs associated therewith, and, if so, it is likely that such relief would only last for a specified period, potentially necessitating additional amendments, waivers or refinancings in the future. 
 In the event that we do not maintain compliance with the covenants under the 2011 Credit Facilities, lenders could declare an event of
default, subject to applicable notice and cure provisions, which would likely result in a material adverse impact on our financial position. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under
the 2011 Credit Facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. In addition, lenders under any of our indebtedness to which a cross-default or cross-acceleration provision applies may then be
entitled to take certain similar actions. In the event any of our lenders or note holders accelerate the required repayment of our borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness. 
 The lenders under the 2011 Credit Facilities have taken security interests in substantially all of our consolidated assets, and we have
pledged the stock of certain of our subsidiaries to secure the debt under the 2011 Credit Facilities. If the lenders accelerate the required repayment of borrowings, we may be forced to liquidate certain assets to repay all or part of such
borrowings, and we cannot assure you that sufficient assets will remain after we have paid all of the borrowings under such 2011 Credit Facilities. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to
them to secure that indebtedness and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Our ability to liquidate assets could also be affected by the regulatory restrictions associated with radio stations, including FCC licensing, which may make the
market for these assets less liquid and increase the chances that these assets would be liquidated at a significant loss. Any requirement for us to liquidate assets would likely have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 We require substantial cash flows to service our debt and other obligations. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows could
have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 In order to service our significant indebtedness, we
require, and will continue to require significant cash flows. Our revenue is subject to such factors as shifts in population, station listenership, demographics, or audience tastes, and fluctuations in preferred advertising media. Our ability to
generate sufficient cash flow to make required principal and interest payments on, or refinance, our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing micro and macro economic and
competitive conditions, some of which are beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain or derive a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, and
may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity
problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and 
 Index to Financial Statements 
 capital expenditures or to seek to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to
effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our inability to generate sufficient cash from
operations to service our debt and other obligations would lead to a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Despite
our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur additional debt. This could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above. 
 We may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Indenture and the 2011 Credit Facilities contain, and credit facilities we enter into in the future may contain, restrictions on
the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and any additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be material. These restrictions also will
not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. 
 Our variable rate indebtedness subjects
us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly. 
 Borrowings under
the First Lien Facility and the Second Lien Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount
borrowed remained the same, and our net income would decrease. As a result, a significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. 
 The terms of the Indenture and the 2011 Credit Facilities restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to
respond to changes or to take certain actions. 
 The Indenture and the 2011 Credit Facilities contain a number of
restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests, including restrictions on our ability to: 
 incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; 
 pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock; 
 prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt; 
 issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; 
 make loans and investments; 
 sell assets; 
 incur liens; 
 enter into transactions with affiliates; 
 alter the businesses we conduct; 
 enter into agreements restricting our restricted subsidiaries ability to pay dividends; and 
 consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets. 
 In addition, as described above, the restrictive covenants in the 2011 Credit Facilities require us to maintain compliance with specified
financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. 
 As a result of these restrictions, we may be: 
 limited in how we conduct our business; 
 unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or 
 unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. 
 Index to Financial Statements 
 These restrictions may adversely affect our ability to operate our current and planned
business, or make certain changes in our business and to respond to changing circumstances, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock 
 The public market for our Class A Common Stock may be volatile. 
 We cannot assure you that the market price of our Class A common stock will not decline and the market price could be subject to wide
fluctuations in response to such factors as: 
 conditions and trends in the radio broadcasting industry; 
 actual or anticipated variations in our operating results, including audience share ratings and financial results; 
 changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; 
 technological innovations; 
 competitive developments; 
 adoption of new accounting standards affecting companies in general or affecting companies in the radio broadcasting industry in particular; and 
 general market conditions and other factors. 
 Further, the stock markets, and in particular the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the market on which our Class A common stock is listed, from time to time have experienced extreme price and volume
fluctuations that were not necessarily related or proportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies. In addition, general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate movements or international
currency fluctuations, may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. 
 Certain stockholders or
groups of stockholders have, and will have, the right to appoint members to our board of directors and, consequently, the ability to exert significant influence over us. 
 As of December 31, 2012, and after giving effect to the exercise of all of their respective options exercisable within 60 days of
that date, Lewis W. Dickey, Jr., our Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer and a director, his brother, John W. Dickey, our Executive Vice President, and their father, Lewis W. Dickey, Sr., together with members of their family (collectively,
the Dickeys), collectively beneficially owned shares representing approximately 13.6% of the outstanding voting power of our common stock. 
 Also as of December 31, 2012, Crestview was our largest shareholder and, according to a Schedule 13D/A filed on December 12, 2012, beneficially owned shares representing approximately 37.5% of our
outstanding Class A common stock on a fully converted basis. 
 In addition, in connection with the financing transactions
undertaken in connection with the completion of the Citadel Merger, on September 16, 2011, the Company entered into a Stockholders Agreement (the Stockholders Agreement) with BA Capital Company, L.P. and Banc of America
Capital Investors SBIC, L.P. (together, the BofA Stockholders), Blackstone, the Dickeys, Crestview, Macquarie and UBS. Under the Stockholders Agreement, the size of the Companys Board was increased to seven members, and the two
vacancies on the Board created thereby were filled by individuals designated by Crestview. In accordance with the Stockholders Agreement, Crestview maintains the right to designate two individuals for nomination to the Board, and each of the
Dickeys, the BofA Stockholders and Blackstone maintains the right to designate one individual for nomination to the Board. The Stockholders Agreement provides that the other two positions on the Board will be filled by directors, who meet applicable
independence criteria. The Stockholders Agreement also 
 Index to Financial Statements 
 provides that, for so long as Crestview is the Companys largest stockholder, it will have the right to have one of its designees, who shall meet the definition of an independent director
and who is elected to the Board, and is selected by it, appointed as the lead director of the Board. Further, the parties to the Stockholders Agreement (other than the Company) have agreed to support such directors (or others as may be
designated by the relevant stockholders) as nominees to be presented to the Companys stockholders for approval at subsequent stockholder meetings for the term set out in the Stockholders Agreement. Each stockholder partys respective
director nomination rights will generally survive for so long as it continues to own a specified percentage of the Companys stock, subject to certain exceptions. 
 As a result of these significant stockholdings, and their right to designate members of our board, these stockholders are expected to be able to continue to exert significant influence over our policies
and management, potentially in a manner which may not be in our best interests or the best interests of the other shareholders.
