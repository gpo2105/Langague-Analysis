Risk Factors 
 Investment
in our securities involves risk. An investor or potential investor should consider the risks summarized in this section when making investment decisions regarding our securities. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the
risk factors set forth below. The risks and uncertainties described in this section are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also affect our business.
If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 We have experienced rapid revenue growth, which may be
difficult to sustain and which may place significant demands on our administrative, operational and financial resources and any inability to maintain or manage our growth could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
condition or business. 
 Our revenues during the three years ended December 31, 2012 have grown at a compound annual
growth rate of 27%. We expect our growth to continue, which could place additional demands on our resources and increase our expenses. Our future growth will depend on, among other things, our ability to successfully grow our total assets under
management and administration and add additional clients. If we are unable to implement our growth strategy, develop new investment solutions and services and gain new clients, our results of operations, financial condition or business may be
materially adversely affected. 
 Sustaining growth will also require us to commit additional management, operational and
financial resources and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems. In addition, continued growth increases the challenges involved in: 
 recruiting, training and retaining sufficiently skilled technical, marketing, sales and management personnel; 
 preserving our culture, values and entrepreneurial environment; 
 successfully expanding the range of investment solutions and services offered to our clients; 
 developing and improving our internal administrative infrastructure, particularly our financial, operational, compliance, record-keeping,
communications and other internal systems; and 
 maintaining high levels of satisfaction with our investment solutions and services among clients. 
 There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or accelerate our growth, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our
results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 Our revenue can fluctuate from period to period, which could cause our share price to fluctuate. 
 Our revenue may fluctuate from period-to-period in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our
control. Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include the following events, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this document: 
 a decline or slowdown of the growth in the value of financial market assets, which may reduce the value of assets under management and administration
and therefore our revenues and cash flows; 
 negative public perception and reputation of the financial services industry, which would reduce demand for our investment solutions and services; 
 unanticipated changes to economic terms in contracts with clients, including renegotiations; 
 downward pressure on fees we charge our clients, which would therefore reduce our revenue; 
 changes in laws or regulations that could impact our ability to offer investment solutions and services; 
 failure to obtain new clients; 
 cancellation or non-renewal of existing contracts with clients; 
 failure to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights; 
 unanticipated delays in connection with the conversion of client assets onto our technology platform; 
 reduction in the suite of investment solutions and services provided to existing clients; or 
 changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors to which we have to adapt. 
 As a result of these and other factors, the results of operations for any quarterly or annual period may differ materially from the
results of operations for any prior or future quarterly or annual period and should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance. 
 We operate in a highly competitive industry, with many firms competing for business from financial advisors on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality and breadth of investment
solutions and services, ability to innovate, reputation and the prices of services and this competition could hurt our financial performance. 
 We compete with many different types of companies that vary in size and scope, including Pershing LLC (a subsidiary of BNY Mellon Corporation), The Charles Schwab Corporation, SEI Investments Company,
Genworth Financial Inc., Advent Software, Inc., and Lockwood Advisors (a subsidiary of BNY Mellon Corporation) and which are discussed in greater detail under BusinessCompetition included in this Form 10-K. In addition, some of our
clients have developed or may develop the in-house capability to provide the technology and/or investment advisory services they have retained us to perform. These clients may also offer internally developed services to their financial advisors,
obviating the need to hire us, and they may offer these services to third-party financial advisors or financial institutions, thereby competing directly with us for that business. 
 Many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do. These resources may allow our competitors to respond more
quickly to changes in demand for investment solutions and services, to devote greater resources to developing and promoting their services and to make more attractive offers to potential clients and strategic partners, which could hurt our financial
performance. 
 We may lose clients as a result of the sale or merger of a client, a change in a clients senior
management, competition from other financial advisors and financial institutions and for other reasons. We also face increased competition due to the current trend of industry consolidation. If large financial institutions that are not our clients
are able to attract assets from our clients, our ability to grow revenues and earnings may be adversely affected. 
 Our Envestnet | PMC group competes with other providers of investment solutions and
products. These competitors may offer broader solutions and/or products and their solutions and/or products may have better investment returns during one or more periods. If the investment returns on our investment products are not perceived to be
competitive, we could experience outflows of assets from these products and face difficulty attracting new assets to these products. 
 Our failure to successfully compete in any of the above-mentioned areas could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business. Competition could also affect
the revenue mix of services we provide, resulting in decreased revenues in lines of business with higher profit margins. 
 We derive nearly
all of our revenues from the delivery of investment solutions and services to clients in the financial advisory industry and our revenue could suffer if that industry experiences a downturn. 
 A decline or lack of growth in demand for financial advisory services would adversely affect our clients and, in turn, our results of
operations, financial condition and business. For example, the availability of free or low-cost investment information and resources, including research and information relating to publicly traded companies and mutual funds available on the Internet
or on company websites, could lead to lower demand by investors for the services provided by financial advisors. In addition, demand for our investment solutions and services among financial advisors could decline for many reasons. Consolidation or
limited growth in the financial advisory industry could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients. Events that adversely affect our clients businesses, rates of growth or the numbers of customers they serve, including decreased
demand for our clients products and services, adverse conditions in our clients markets or adverse economic conditions generally, could decrease demand for our investment solutions and services and thereby decrease our revenues. Any of
the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 A limited number of
clients account for a material portion of our revenue. Termination of our contracts with any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, revenues associated with our relationship with our single largest client, FMR
LLC, an affiliate of FMR Corp., or Fidelity, accounted for 22%, 31% and 31% respectively, of our total revenues and our ten largest clients accounted for 47%, 64% and 62%, respectively, of our total revenues. Our license agreements with large
financial institutions are generally multi-year contracts that may be terminated upon the expiration of the contract term or prior to such time for cause, which may include breach of contract, bankruptcy, insolvency and other reasons. The license
fee payments pursuant to our license agreement with Fidelity were renegotiated and reduced as of December 31, 2011 and were extended for an additional five years. The agreement, as amended, includes receiving ongoing platform services fees
through the Fidelity relationship based upon asset-based fees. No assurance can be given as to whether any projected increase in asset-based fees will offset the reduction in license fees. A majority of our agreements with financial advisors
generally provides for termination at any time. If our contractual relationship with Fidelity were to terminate, or if a significant number of our most important clients were to terminate their contracts with us and we were unable to obtain a
significant number of new clients, our results of operations, financial condition or business could be materially adversely affected. 
 Our
clients that pay us an asset-based fee may seek to negotiate a lower fee percentage or may cease using our services, which could limit the growth of, or decrease, our revenues. 
 A significant portion of our revenues are derived from asset-based fees. Our clients may, for a number of reasons, seek to negotiate a
lower asset-based fee percentage. For example, an increase in the use of index-linked investment products by the clients of our financial advisor clients may result in lower fees being paid to our clients, and our clients may in turn seek to
negotiate lower asset-based fee percentages for our services. In addition, as competition among our clients increases, they may be required to lower the fees they charge to their 
 clients, which could cause them to seek to decrease our fees accordingly. Any of these factors could result in fluctuation or a decline in our asset-based fees, which would have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 Changes in market and economic conditions could lower the
value of assets on which we earn revenues and could decrease the demand for our investment solutions and services. 
 Asset-based fees make up a significant portion of our revenues. Asset-based fees represented 81%, 81% and 77% of our total revenues for
the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We expect that asset-based fees will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total revenues in the future. Significant fluctuations in securities prices may
materially affect the value of the assets managed by our clients and may also influence financial advisor and investor decisions regarding whether to invest in, or maintain an investment in, a mutual fund or other investment solution. If such market
fluctuation led to less investment in the securities markets, our revenues and earnings derived from asset-based fees could be materially adversely affected. 
 We provide our investment solutions and services to the financial services industry. The financial markets, and in turn the financial services industry, are affected by many factors, such as U.S. and
foreign economic conditions and general trends in business and finance that are beyond our control. In the event that the U.S. or international financial markets suffer a severe or prolonged downturn, investors may choose to withdraw assets from
financial advisors, which we refer to as redemptions, and transfer them to investments that are perceived to be more secure, such as bank deposits and Treasury securities. For example, in late 2007 and through the first quarter of 2009,
the financial markets experienced a broad and prolonged downturn, our redemption rates were higher than our historical average, and our results of operations, financial condition and business were materially adversely affected. Any prolonged
downturn in financial markets or increased levels of asset withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 Investors decisions regarding their investment assets are affected by many factors and investors may redeem or withdraw their investment assets generally at any time. Significant changes in
investing patterns or large-scale withdrawal of investment funds could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 The clients of our financial advisors are generally free to change financial advisors, forgo the advice and other services provided by financial advisors or withdraw the funds they have invested with
financial advisors. These clients of financial advisors may elect to change their investment strategies, by moving their assets away from equity securities to fixed income or other investment options, or by withdrawing all or a portion of their
assets from their accounts to avoid all securities markets-related risks. These actions by investors are outside of our control and could materially adversely affect the market value of the investment assets that our clients manage, which could
materially adversely affect the asset-based fees we receive from our clients. 
 We are subject to liability for losses that result from a
breach of our fiduciary duties. 
 Our investment advisory services involve fiduciary obligations that require us to act in
the best interests of our clients, and we may be sued and face liabilities for actual or claimed breaches of our fiduciary duties. Because we provide investment advisory services, both directly and indirectly, with respect to substantial assets we
could face substantial liability to our clients if it is determined that we have breached our fiduciary duties. In certain circumstances, which generally depend on the types of investment solutions and services we are providing, we may enter into
client agreements jointly with advisors and retain third-party investment money managers on behalf of clients. As a result, we may be included as a defendant in lawsuits against financial advisors and third-party investment money managers that
involve claims of breaches of the duties of such persons, and we may face liabilities for the improper actions and/or omissions of such advisors and third-party investment money managers. In addition, we may face claims based on the results of our
investment advisory recommendations, even in the absence of a breach of our fiduciary duty. Such claims and liabilities could therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 We are subject to liability for losses that result from potential, perceived or actual conflicts of
interest. 
 Potential, perceived and actual conflicts of interest are inherent in our existing and future business
activities and could give rise to client dissatisfaction, litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. In particular, we pay varying fees to third-party asset managers and custodians and our financial advisor customers, or their clients, could
accuse us of directing them toward those asset managers or custodians that charge us the lowest fees. In addition, we offer proprietary mutual funds and portfolios of mutual funds through our internal investment management and portfolio consulting
group, and financial advisors or their clients could conclude that we favor our proprietary investment products because of their belief that we earn higher fees when our proprietary investment products are used. Adequately addressing conflicts of
interest is complex and difficult and if we fail, or appear to fail, to adequately address potential, perceived or actual conflicts of interest, the resulting negative public perception and reputational harm could materially adversely affect our
client relations or ability to enter into contracts with new clients and, consequently, our results of operations, financial condition and business. 
 If our reputation is harmed, our results of operations, financial condition or business could be materially adversely affected. 
 Our reputation, which depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of our clients, is critical to our business. Our
reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or impossible to remediate. Regulatory inquiries or investigations, lawsuits initiated by our clients or stockholders, employee misconduct,
perceptions of conflicts of interest and rumors, among other developments, could substantially damage our reputation, even if they are baseless or satisfactorily addressed. In addition, any perception that the quality of our investment solutions and
services may not be the same or better than that of other providers, can also damage our reputation. Any damage to our reputation could harm our ability to attract and retain clients, which would materially adversely affect our results of
operations, financial condition and business. 
 If our investment solutions and services fail to perform properly due to undetected errors
or similar problems, our results of operations, financial condition and business could be materially adversely affected. 
 Investment solutions and services we develop or license may contain undetected errors or defects despite testing. Such errors can exist
at any point in the life cycle of our investment solutions or services, but are frequently found after introduction of new investment solutions and services or enhancements to existing investment solutions or services. We continually introduce new
investment solutions and services and new versions of our investment solutions and services. Despite internal testing and testing by current and potential clients, our current and future investment solutions and services may contain serious defects
or malfunctions. If we detect any errors before release, we might be required to delay the release of the investment solution or service for an extended period of time while we address the problem. We might not discover errors that affect our new or
current investment solutions, services or enhancements until after they are deployed, and we may need to provide enhancements to correct such errors. Errors may occur that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
condition or business and could result in harm to our reputation, lost sales, delays in commercial release, third-party claims, contractual disputes, contract terminations or renegotiations, or unexpected expenses and diversion of management and
other resources to remedy errors. In addition, negative public perception and reputational damage caused by such claims would adversely affect our client relationships and our ability to enter into new contracts. Any of these problems could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business. 
 We could face liability or incur costs to remediate operational errors or to address possible customer
dissatisfaction. 
 Operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including, but not
limited to, improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions, deficiencies in our operating systems, business disruptions and inadequacies or breaches in our internal control processes. We operate in diverse markets and are reliant
on the ability of our employees and systems to process large volumes of transactions often within short time frames. In the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems, human error or improper action by employees, we could suffer financial
loss, regulatory sanctions or damage to our reputation. 
 In addition, there may be circumstances when our customers are
dissatisfied with our investment solutions and services, even in the absence of an operational error. In such circumstances, we may elect to make payments or otherwise incur increased costs or lower revenues in order to maintain a strong customer
relationship. In any of the forgoing circumstances, our results of operations, financial condition or business could be materially adversely affected. 
 We may become subject to liability based on the use of our investment solutions and services by our clients. 
 Our investment solutions and services support the investment processes of our clients, which, in the aggregate, manage billions of dollars of assets. Our client agreements have provisions designed to
limit our exposure to potential liability claims brought by our clients or third parties based on the use of our investment solutions and services. However, these provisions have certain exceptions and could be invalidated by unfavorable judicial
decisions or by federal, state, foreign or local laws. Use of our products as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients, or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients, may pursue claims against us for very significant
dollar amounts. Any such claim, even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us, would involve a significant commitment of our management, personnel, financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation. Such
claims and lawsuits could therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 Furthermore, our clients may use our investment solutions and services together with software, data or products from other companies. As a result, when problems occur, it might be difficult to identify
the source of the problem. Even when our investment solutions and services do not cause these problems, the existence of these errors might cause us to incur significant costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel, any
of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 Our business relies heavily on
computer equipment, electronic delivery systems and the Internet. Any failures or disruptions in such technologies could result in reduced revenues, increased costs and the loss of customers. 
 Our business relies heavily on our computer equipment (including our servers), electronic delivery systems and the Internet, but these
technologies are vulnerable to disruptions, failures or slowdowns caused by fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, wars, Internet failures, computer viruses and other events beyond our control. Furthermore, we
rely on agreements with our suppliers, such as our current data hosting and service provider, to provide us with access to certain computer equipment, electric delivery systems and the Internet. We are unable to predict whether a future contractual
dispute may arise with one of our suppliers that could cause a disruption in service, or whether our agreements with our suppliers can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms, or at all. An unanticipated disruption, failure or slowdown affecting
our key technologies or facilities may have significant ramifications, such as data-loss, data corruption, damaged software codes or inaccurate processing of transactions. We maintain off-site back-up facilities for our electronic information and
computer equipment, but these facilities could be subject to the same interruptions that may 
 affect our primary facilities. Any significant disruptions, failures, slowdowns, data-loss or data corruption could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
condition or business and result in the loss of customers. 
 We could face liability related to disclosure or theft of the personal
information we store on our technology platform. 
 Clients may maintain personal investment and financial information on
our technology platform and we could be subject to liability if we were to inappropriately disclose any users personal information, inadvertently or otherwise, or if third parties were able to penetrate our network security or otherwise gain
access to any users name, address, portfolio holdings or other financial information. Any such event could subject us to claims for misuses of personal information, such as unauthorized marketing or unauthorized access to personal portfolio
information and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 We could
incur significant costs protecting the personal information we store on our technology platform. 
 Users of our investment
solutions and services are located in the United States and around the world. As a result, we collect and store the personal information of individuals who live in many different countries. Privacy regulators in some of those countries have publicly
stated that foreign entities (including entities based in the United States) may render themselves subject to those countries privacy laws and the jurisdiction of such regulators by collecting or storing the personal data of those
countries residents, even if such entities have no physical or legal presence there. Consequently, we may be obligated to comply with the privacy and data security laws of such foreign countries. Our exposure to foreign countries privacy
and data security laws impacts our ability to collect and use personal information, increases our legal compliance costs and may expose us to liability. 
 We have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations. Increased
domestic or international regulation of data utilization and distribution practices could require us to modify our operations and incur significant additional expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial condition or business. 
 We could face liability for certain information we provide, including information based on data we obtain
from other parties. 
 We may be subject to claims for securities law violations, negligence, breach of fiduciary duties or
other claims relating to the information we provide. For example, individuals may take legal action against us if they rely on information we have provided and it contains an error. In addition, we could be subject to claims based upon the content
that is accessible from our website through links to other websites. Moreover, we could face liability based on inaccurate information provided to us by others. Defending any such claims could be expensive and time-consuming, and any such claim
could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 We depend on our senior management team and
other key personnel and the loss of their services could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 We depend on the efforts, relationships and reputations of our senior management team and other key personnel, including Judson Bergman, our Chief Executive Officer, William Crager, our President, and
Scott Grinis, our Chief Technology Officer, in order to successfully manage our business. We believe that success in our business will continue to be based upon the strength of our intellectual capital. The loss of the services of any member of our
senior management team or of other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 Our operations are subject to extensive government regulation, and compliance failures or regulatory
action against us could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 The financial
services industry is among the most extensively regulated industries in the United States. We operate investment advisory, broker-dealer, mutual fund and collective investment trust lines of business, each of which is subject to a specific and
extensive regulatory scheme. In addition, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations of general application. It is very difficult to predict the future impact of the legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business and our
clients businesses. 
 Certain of our subsidiaries are registered as investment advisers with the SEC under
the Advisers Act and are regulated thereunder. In addition, many of our investment advisory services are conducted pursuant to the non-exclusive safe harbor from the definition of an investment company provided under Rule 3a-4 under
the Investment Company Act. If Rule 3a-4 were to cease to be available, or if the SEC were to modify the rule or its interpretation of how the rule is applied, our business could be adversely affected. Certain of our registered investment
adviser subsidiaries provide advice to mutual fund clients and collective investment trusts. Mutual funds are registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act. The Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, together
with related regulations and interpretations of the SEC, impose numerous obligations and restrictions on investment advisers and mutual funds, including requirements relating to the safekeeping of client funds and securities, limitations on
advertising, disclosure and reporting obligations, prohibitions on fraudulent activities, restrictions on transactions between an adviser and its clients, and between a mutual fund and its advisers and affiliates, and other detailed operating
requirements, as well as general fiduciary obligations. Collective investment trusts are unregistered funds operated by a trust company or a bank regulated by the OCC. In our role as advisor to these funds, we operate under substantially similar
obligations to those discussed above for mutual funds. 
 In addition, PBS, our broker-dealer subsidiary, is registered as a
broker-dealer with the SEC and with all 50 states and the District of Columbia, and is a member of FINRA, a securities industry self-regulatory organization that supervises and regulates the conduct and activities of its members. Broker-dealers are
subject to regulations that cover all aspects of their business, including sales practices, market making and trading among broker-dealers, use and safekeeping of customer funds and securities, capital structure, recordkeeping and the conduct of
directors, officers, employees, representatives and associated persons. FINRA conducts periodic examinations of the operations of its members, including PBS. As a broker-dealer, PBS is also subject to certain minimum net capital requirements under
SEC and FINRA rules. Compliance with the net capital rules may limit our ability to withdraw capital from PBS. 
 All of the
foregoing laws and regulations are complex and we are required to expend significant resources in order to maintain our compliance with such laws and regulations. Any failure on our part to comply with these and other applicable laws and regulations
could result in regulatory fines, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of our registration or that of our subsidiaries as an investment adviser or broker-dealer, as the case may be, which could, among other things,
require changes to our business practices and scope of operations or harm our reputation, which, in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 Changes to the laws or regulations applicable to us or to our financial advisor clients could adversely affect our results of operations, financial
condition or business. 
 We may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by
the SEC or other U.S. or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets around the world. In addition, we may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of
existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations. It is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed, or whether any current proposals
will become law, and it is difficult to predict how any changes or potential changes could affect our business. Changes to laws or regulations could increase our potential liability in 
 connection with the investment solutions and services that we provide. The introduction of any new laws or regulations could make our ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations more
difficult and expensive. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 A deemed change of control of our company could require us to obtain the consent of our clients and a failure to do so properly could adversely affect our results of operations, financial
condition or business. 
 Under the Advisers Act, the investment advisory agreements entered into by our investment adviser
subsidiaries may not be assigned without the clients consent. Under the Investment Company Act, advisory agreements with registered funds terminate automatically upon assignment and, any assignment of an advisory agreement must be approved by
the board of directors and the shareholders of the registered fund. Under the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, such an assignment may be deemed to occur upon a change of control of the Company. A change of control includes both gaining
or losing a controlling person. Whether someone is a controlling person for these purposes depends significantly on the specific facts and circumstances. There can be no assurance that if we undergo a change of control, we would be
successful in obtaining all necessary consents or that the method by which we obtain such consents could not be challenged at a later time. If we are unable to obtain all necessary consents or if such a challenge were to be successful it could have
a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 We rely on exemptions from certain laws and if
for any reason these exemptions were to become unavailable to us, we could become subject to regulatory action or third-party claims and our business could be materially and adversely affected. 
 We regularly rely on exemptions from various requirements of the Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act and the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 in conducting our activities. These exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may in certain circumstances depend on compliance by third parties whom we do not control. If for any reason these exemptions were to become
unavailable to us, we could become subject to regulatory action or third-party claims and our business could be materially and adversely affected. 
 If government regulation of the Internet or other areas of our business changes, or if consumer attitudes toward use of the Internet change, we may need to change the manner in which we conduct our
business or incur greater operating expenses. 
 The adoption, modification or interpretation of laws or regulations
relating to the Internet or other areas of our business could adversely affect the manner in which we conduct our business. Such laws and regulations may cover sales practices, taxes, user privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights,
distribution, electronic contracts, consumer protection, broadband residential Internet access and the characteristics and quality of services. Moreover, it is not clear how existing laws governing these matters apply to the Internet. If we are
required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation, we may be required to incur additional expenses or alter our business model, either of which could have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 We are substantially dependent on our intellectual property rights, and a
failure to protect these rights could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 We
have made substantial investments in software and other intellectual property on which our business is highly dependent. We rely on trade secret, trademark and copyright laws, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and other contractual and
technical security measures to protect our proprietary technology. Any loss of our intellectual property rights, or any significant claim of infringement or indemnity for violation of the intellectual property rights of others, could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 None of our technologies, investment solutions or services is covered by any copyright
registration, issued patent or patent application. We are the owner of eight registered trademarks in the United States, including ENVESTNET, and we claim common law rights in other trademarks that are not registered. We cannot guarantee
that: 
 our intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us; 
 our ability to assert our intellectual property rights against potential competitors or to settle current or future disputes will not be limited by our
agreements with third parties; 
 our intellectual property rights will be enforced in jurisdictions where competition may be intense or where legal protection may be weak; 
 any of the trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights that we presently employ in our business will not lapse or be
invalidated, circumvented, challenged or abandoned; 
 our trademark applications will lead to registered trademarks; or 
 competitors will not design around our intellectual property rights or develop similar technologies, investment solutions or products; or that we will
not lose the ability to assert our intellectual property rights against others. 
 We are also a party to a
number of third-party intellectual property license agreements. Some of these license agreements require us to make one-time payments or ongoing subscription payments. We cannot guarantee that the third-party intellectual property we license will
not be licensed to our competitors or others in our industry. In the future, we may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on
acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, we have granted our customers certain rights to use our intellectual property in the ordinary course of our business. Some of our customer agreements restrict our ability to license or develop certain
customized technology or services within certain markets or to certain competitors of our customers. For example, our agreement with Fidelity restricts our ability to develop an enterprise-level integration or combination of products and services
substantially similar to the technology platform we have developed for Fidelity. Some of our customer agreements grant our customers ownership rights with respect to the portion of the intellectual property we have developed or customized for our
customers. In addition, some of our customer agreements require us to deposit the source code to the customized technology and investment solutions with a source code escrow agent, which source code may be released in the event we enter into
bankruptcy or are unable to provide support and maintenance of the technology or investment solutions we have licensed to our customers. These provisions in our agreements may limit our ability to grow our business in the future. 
 Third parties may sue us for intellectual property infringement or misappropriation which, if successful, could require us to pay significant damages
or make changes to the investment solutions or services that we offer. 
 We cannot be certain that our internally developed
or acquired technologies, investment solutions or services do not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. In addition, we license content, software and other intellectual property rights from third parties and may be
subject to claims of infringement if such parties do not possess the necessary intellectual property rights to the products they license to us. The risk of infringement claims against us will increase if more of our competitors are able to obtain
patents for investment solutions or services or business processes. In addition, we face additional risk of infringement or misappropriation claims if we hire an employee who possesses third party proprietary information who decides to use such
information in connection with our investment solutions, services or business processes without such third-partys authorization. We have in the past been and may in the future be subject to legal proceedings and claims that we have infringed
or misappropriated the intellectual property rights of a third party. These claims sometimes involve patent holding companies who have no relevant product revenues and against whom our own proprietary technology may therefore provide little or no
deterrence. In addition, third parties may in the future 
 assert intellectual property infringement claims against our customers, which, in certain circumstances, we have agreed to indemnify. Any intellectual property related infringement or
misappropriation claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in costly litigation and could divert management resources and attention. Moreover, should we be found liable for infringement or misappropriation, we may be required to enter into
licensing agreements, if available on acceptable terms or at all, pay substantial damages or make changes to the investment solutions and services that we offer. Any of the foregoing could prevent us from competing effectively, result in substantial
costs to us, divert managements attention and our resources away from our operations and otherwise harm our reputation. 
 If our
intellectual property and proprietary technology are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors, our business and competitive position would suffer. 
 Our future success and competitive position depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. The steps we have
taken to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate to prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary technology. There can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar or superior technologies, investment
solutions or services. Unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technologies could enable third parties to benefit from our intellectual property rights without paying us for doing so, which could harm our business. Policing
unauthorized use of proprietary technology is difficult and expensive and our monitoring and policing activities may not be sufficient to identify any misappropriation and protect our proprietary technology. In addition, third parties may knowingly
or unknowingly infringe our trademarks and other intellectual property rights, and litigation may be necessary to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. If litigation is necessary to protect and enforce our intellectual property
rights, any such litigation could be very costly and could divert management attention and resources. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties independently develop or gain access to our or similar
technologies, investment solutions or services, our results of operations, financial condition and business could be materially adversely affected. 
 The use of open source code in investment solutions may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property rights. 
 To a limited extent, we rely on open source code to develop our investment solutions and support our internal systems and infrastructure.
While we monitor our use of open source code to attempt to avoid subjecting our investment solutions to conditions we do not intend, such use could inadvertently occur. Additionally, if a third-party software provider has incorporated certain types
of open source code into software we license from such third party for our investment solutions, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to disclose the source code for our investment solutions. This could harm our intellectual property
position and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business. 
 Confidentiality agreements
with employees, consultants and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information. 
 We have devoted substantial resources to the development of our proprietary technologies, investment solutions and services. In order to protect our proprietary rights, we enter into confidentiality
agreements with our employees, consultants and independent contractors. These agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or unauthorized parties from copying aspects of our technologies, investment
solutions or products or obtaining and using information that we regard as proprietary. Moreover, these agreements may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of such unauthorized disclosures of confidential information and we cannot assure you
that our rights under such agreements will be enforceable. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Costly and
time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could reduce any competitive advantage we have developed and cause us to lose
customers or otherwise harm our business. 
 Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could strain our resources. In addition, there are
significant risks associated with growth through acquisitions, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 We expect to grow our business by, among other things, making acquisitions. In December 2011, we completed the acquisition of FundQuest and in the second quarter of 2012, we completed the acquisitions of
Prima, Tamarac, and on April 11, 2013, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of the WMS, which we anticipate will be completed in the third quarter of 2013. Acquisitions involve a number of risks. They can
be time-consuming and may divert managements attention from day-to-day operations. Financing an acquisition could result in dilution from issuing equity securities or a weaker balance sheet from using cash or incurring debt. Acquisitions might
also result in losing key employees. In addition, we may fail to successfully integrate acquisitions successfully. We may also fail to generate enough revenues or profits from an acquisition to earn a return on the associated purchase price. 
 To the extent we grow our business through acquisitions, any such future acquisitions could present a number of other risks,
including: 
 incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations or assets or expected cost reductions or other synergies expected to be
realized as a result of acquiring operations or assets; 
 failure to integrate the operations or management of any acquired operations or assets successfully and on a timely and cost effective basis; 
 insufficient knowledge of the operations and markets of acquired businesses; 
 loss of key personnel; 
 failure to obtain necessary customer consents or retain key customers; 
 diversion of managements attention from existing operations or other priorities; 
 increased costs or liabilities as a result of undetected or undisclosed legal, regulatory or financial issues related to acquired operations or assets;
and 
 inability to secure, on terms we find acceptable, sufficient financing that may be required for any such acquisition or investment. 
 In addition, if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other businesses, operations or assets or
if such opportunities for expansion do not arise, our results of operations, financial condition or business could be materially adversely affected. 
 Our failure to successfully execute the conversion of our clients assets from their technology platform to our platform in a timely and accurate manner could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 When we begin working with a new client, or acquire new client
assets through an acquisition or other transaction, we are often required to convert the new assets from the clients technology platform to our technology platform. These conversions present significant technological and operational
challenges, can be time-consuming and may divert managements attention from other operational activities. If we fail to successfully complete our conversions in a timely and accurate manner, we may be required to expend more time and resources
than anticipated, which could erode the profitability of the client relationship. In addition, any such failure may harm our reputation and may make it less likely that prospective clients will commit to working with us. Any of these risks could
materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 Our business will suffer if we do not keep up with rapid technological change, evolving industry
standards or changing requirements of clients. 
 We expect technological developments to continue at a rapid pace in our
industry. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to: 
 continue to develop our technology expertise; 
 recruit and retain skilled technology professionals; 
 enhance our current investment solutions and services; 
 develop new investment solutions and services that meet changing client needs; 
 advertise and market our investment solutions and services; 
 protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights; or 
 influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes. 
 We must accomplish these tasks in a timely and cost-effective manner and our failure to do so could materially adversely affect our
results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 We must continue to introduce new investment solutions and services and investment
solution and service enhancements to address our clients changing needs, market changes and technological developments and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 The market for our investment solutions and services is characterized by shifting client demands, evolving market
practices and, for some of our investment solutions and services, rapid technological change. Changing client demands, new market practices or new technologies can render existing investment solutions and services obsolete and unmarketable. As a
result, our future success will continue to depend upon our ability to develop new investment solutions and services and investment solution and service enhancements that address the future needs of our target markets and respond to technological
and market changes. We incurred technology development expenditures of $8,659, $6,424 and $5,588 in the years ended December, 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We expect that our technology development expenditures will continue at this level
or they may increase in the future. We may not be able to accurately estimate the impact of new investment solutions and services on our business or how their benefits will be perceived by our clients. Further, we may not be successful in
developing, introducing, marketing and licensing our new investment solutions or services or investment solution or service enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis, or at all, and our new investment solutions and services and enhancements
may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance. In addition, clients may delay purchases in anticipation of new investment solutions or services or enhancements. Any of these factors could materially
adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or business. 
 In preparing our financial statements for 2012, we identified
a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and our failure to remedy this or other material weaknesses that we may identify in the future could result in material misstatements in our financial statements. 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in
internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 The material weaknesses identified by management as of December 31, 2012 consisted of
inadequate and ineffective controls over income tax accounting. As a result of this material weakness, our management concluded as of December 31, 2012 that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission in Internal ControlAn Integrated Framework (September 1992). 
 If the remedial measures we have begun implementing that are designed to address this material weakness are insufficient to address this material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or
significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results. 
 Risks Related to our Common Stock 
 Our share price may be volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline. 
 An active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained, which could depress the trading price of our common stock. The price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue
to be, volatile, which means that it could decline substantially within a short period of time. The market price of shares of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, many of
which are beyond our control, including: 
 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results; 
 changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other companies engaged in providing wealth management software and services; 
 loss of a significant amount of existing business; 
 actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors; 
 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our competitors operating results or changes in their growth rates; 
 issuance of new or updated research reports by securities analysts; 
 our announcement of actual results for a fiscal period that are higher or lower than projected results or our announcement of revenue or earnings
guidance that is higher or lower than expected; 
 regulatory developments in our target markets affecting us, our customers or our competitors; 
 fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us; 
 share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares; 
 sales or expected sales of additional common stock; 
 terrorist attacks or natural disasters or other such events impacting countries where we or our customers have operations; and 
 general economic and market conditions. 
 Furthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations
often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or
international currency fluctuations, may cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action
litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our managements attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our
business. 
 Our insiders who are significant stockholders may have interests that conflict with those of other
stockholders. 
 Our directors and executive officers, together with members of their immediate families, as a group,
beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 24% of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2012. As a result, when acting together, this group has the ability to exercise significant influence over most matters requiring our
stockholders approval, including the election and removal of directors and significant corporate transactions. The interests of our insider stockholders may not be aligned with the interests of our other stockholders and conflicts of interest
may arise. In addition, the concentration of our shares may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing significant corporate transactions which may otherwise adversely affect the market price of our shares. 
 The future sale of shares of our common stock may negatively impact our stock price. 
 If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could fall. A reduction in
ownership by a large stockholder could cause the market price of our common stock to fall. In December 2012, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 for the potential resale of shares representing up to approximately 24% of our outstanding
common stock. While that Form S-3 is no longer effective, such registration could indicate a present desire to sell those shares. In addition, the average daily trading volume in our stock is relatively low. The lack of trading activity in our stock
may lead to greater fluctuations in our stock price. Low trading volume may also make it difficult for stockholders to execute transactions in a timely fashion. 
 Certain provisions in our charter documents and agreements and Delaware law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for our company and prevent changes in our management. 
 Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contains provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to
discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in management that our stockholders might deem advantageous. As a result of these provisions in our certificate of incorporation, the price investors may be willing to pay
for shares of our common stock may be limited. 
 In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, which imposes certain restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our common stock. 
 We do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the
price of our common stock. 
 We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the
foreseeable future. Consequently, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not
purchase our common stock.
