You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities.  Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies such as general economic conditions, geopolitical events, competition, technological obsolescence and employee relations.  The risks described below, along with risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial, may impair our business operations and our liquidity in an adverse way. \n Our advertising revenue can vary substantially from period to period based on many factors beyond our control.  This volatility affects our operating results and may reduce our ability to repay indebtedness or reduce the market value of our securities. \n We rely on sales of advertising time for most of our revenues and, as a result, our operating results depend on the amount of advertising revenue we generate.  If we generate less advertising revenue, it may be more difficult for us to repay our indebtedness and the value of our business may decline.  Our ability to sell advertising time depends on: \n · the levels of automobile advertising, which historically have represented about one quarter of our advertising revenue; however, for the year ended December 31, 2012, automobile advertising represented 20.8% of our net time sales; \n · the health of the economy in the area where our television stations are located and in the nation as a whole; \n · the popularity of our programming and that of our competition; \n · the levels of political advertising, which are affected by campaign finance laws and the ability of political candidates and political action committees to raise and spend funds and are subject to seasonal fluctuations; \n · the reliability of our ratings information measurements, including new ratings system technologies such as people meters and set-top boxes; \n · changes in the makeup of the population in the areas where our stations are located; \n · the activities of our competitors, including increased competition from other forms of advertising-based mediums, such as other broadcast television stations, radio stations, MVPDs, internet and broadband content providers and other print and media outlets serving in the same markets; and \n · other factors that may be beyond our control. \n After a severe economic recession in 2008 and 2009 that affected our advertising revenue, we experienced a rebound in advertising spending in 2010 due primarily to a resurgence of the automotive industry, our largest advertising category, and a contentious mid-term election resulting in record political revenues. In 2012, we recorded record levels of political advertising and benefited from strong results in our automotive advertising category. There can be no assurance that our advertising revenue will not be volatile in the future or that such volatility will not have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations. \n We have a high level of debt, totaling $2,273.4 million at December 31, 2012, compared to the book value of shareholders deficit of $100.1 million on the same date.  Our relatively high level of debt poses the following risks, particularly in periods of declining revenues: \n · we may be unable to service our debt obligations, including payments on notes as they come due, especially during general negative economic and market industry conditions; \n · we may use a significant portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt, especially during general negative economic and market industry conditions; \n · the amount available for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and other general corporate purposes may be limited because a significant portion of cash flow is used to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt; \n · our lenders may not be as willing to lend additional amounts to us for future working capital needs, additional acquisitions or other purposes; \n · the cost to borrow from lenders may increase; \n · our ability to access the capital markets may be limited, and we may be unable to issue securities with pricing or other terms that we find attractive, if at all; \n · if our cash flow were inadequate to make interest and principal payments, we might have to restructure or refinance our indebtedness or sell one or more of our stations to reduce debt service obligations; \n · we may be more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than less leveraged competitors and thus, less able to withstand competitive pressures; and
