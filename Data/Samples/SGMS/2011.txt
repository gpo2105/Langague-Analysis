Risks Relating to Our Business 
 We operate in highly competitive industries and our success depends on our ability to effectively compete with numerous domestic and foreign businesses. 
 We face competition from a number of domestic and foreign businesses, some of which have substantially greater financial resources than
we do, which impacts our ability to win new contracts and 
 renew
existing contracts. We continue to operate in a period of intense price-based competition, which has affected and could continue to affect the number and the profitability of the contracts we
win. 
 Contract
awards by lottery authorities are sometimes challenged by unsuccessful bidders, which can result in costly and protracted legal proceedings that can result in delayed
implementation or cancellation of the award. In addition, the U.S. lottery industry has matured such that the number of states conducting lotteries is unlikely to increase materially in the
near-term. 
 We
believe our principal competitors in the instant ticket lottery business have increased their production capacity, which is expected to increase pricing pressures in the instant
ticket business and adversely affect our ability to win or renew instant ticket contracts or reduce the profitability of instant ticket contracts that we do win. Our domestic instant ticket business
could also be adversely affected should additional foreign competitors in Canada export their lottery products to the U.S. or should other foreign competitors establish printing facilities in the U.S.
or Canada to supply the U.S. We also compete in the international instant ticket lottery business with low-price, low-quality printers in a regulated environment where laws are
being reinterpreted so as to create competition from non-traditional lottery vendors and products. 
 We
face increased price competition in our lottery systems business from our two principal competitors. Since late 2007, we have lost lottery systems contracts in South Carolina, West
Virginia, South Dakota, New Hampshire and Vermont to our competitors following the expiration of our contracts. During 2010, the lottery authority in Maine awarded a new lottery contract to one of our
competitors, which award was subsequently invalidated as a result of our protest. The competitor's appeal of the protest ruling was denied on October 21, 2011. Our contract with Maine was
extended for one year until June 30, 2012 pending further action by the Maine lottery authority. 
 Pricing
pressures and potential privatizations (including partial privatizations through private management agreements or otherwise) of some lotteries may also change the manner in which
lottery system and instant ticket contracts are awarded and the profitability of those contracts. Any future success of our lottery business will also depend, in part, on the success of the lottery
industry in attracting and retaining players in the face of increased competition for these players' entertainment dollars, as well as our own success in developing innovative products and systems to
achieve this goal. Our failure to achieve this goal could reduce our revenue from our lottery operations. As a result of pressures on state and other government budgets, other forms of gaming may be
legalized, which could adversely impact our business. 
 Our
gaming-related businesses face competition from other vendors as well as illegal operators, and changes in law and regulation can affect our future profitability. William
Hill PLC, a U.K. bookmaker, recently awarded a contract to one of our principal competitors (currently the supplier for a majority of gaming machines for William Hill) for the sole supply of
gaming machines to William Hill following the expiration of our gaming machine supply contract with William Hill in March 2012. 
 We
expect to face significant competition as we seek to offer products and services for the evolving internet lottery and gaming industries, not only from our traditional competitors in
the lottery business but also from a number of other domestic and foreign providers (or the operators themselves), some of which have substantially greater financial resources and/or experience in
this area than we do. 
 In
our prepaid phone card business, we are operating in a period of intense price-based competition, which is likely to continue to negatively affect our revenues and operating margins. 
 Unfavorable domestic and international economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition. 
 Unfavorable general economic conditions, including relatively high rates of unemployment, have had and may continue to have a negative
effect on our business and results of operations. 
 We
cannot fully predict the effects that unfavorable economic conditions and economic uncertainty will have on us as it also impacts our customers, suppliers and business partners.
However, we believe that the difficult economic conditions have contributed to reductions in spending on marketing by our customers and, in certain instances, less favorable terms under our contracts,
as many of our customers face significant budget shortfalls and look to cut costs. 
 We
believe that the lottery and wide area gaming businesses are less susceptible to reductions in consumer spending than the destination gaming business
( 
 e.g. 
 , resort/casino venues, which are typically less accessible than lottery and wide area gaming retail outlets) and other parts of the consumer
sector. However, we believe that declines in consumer spending have adversely impacted our lottery and wide area gaming businesses to some extent, and further declines will likely exacerbate these
negative effects. 
 There
are ongoing concerns regarding the debt burden of certain countries, particularly in the European Union, and their ability to meet their future financial obligations, which have
resulted in recent downgrades of the debt ratings for these countries. These sovereign debt concerns, whether real or perceived, could result in a recession, prolonged economic slowdown, or otherwise
negatively impact the general health and stability of the economies in these countries or more broadly. In more severe cases, this could result in a limitation on the availability of capital, thereby
restricting our liquidity and negatively impacting our operating results. Our growth strategy may involve pursuing expansion or business opportunities in certain countries potentially facing real or
perceived sovereign debt concerns, such as Italy and Greece. 
 Our business is subject to evolving technology. 
 The sales of all of our products and services are affected by changing technology, new legislation and evolving industry standards. Our
ability to anticipate or respond to such changes and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain
competitive, retain existing contracts, and expand and attract new customers. 
 We
can give no assurance that we will achieve the necessary technological advances or have the financial resources needed to introduce new products or services on a timely basis or that
we will otherwise have the ability to compete effectively in the industries we serve. 
 We may not be able capitalize on the expansion of internet or other forms of interactive gaming or other trends and changes in the lottery and gaming industries. 
 Part of our strategy is to take advantage of the liberalization of internet and mobile gaming, both within the U.S. and
internationally. This strategy involves several risks and uncertainties, including legal, business and financial risks. 
 In
general, our ability to successfully pursue our interactive gaming strategy depends on the laws and regulations relating to wagering over the internet and through interactive
channels. Until recently, there was uncertainty as to whether the Wire Act prohibits states from conducting intrastate lottery transactions via the internet if the transmissions over the internet
during the transaction cross state lines. In late 2011, the Office of Legal Counsel of the DOJ issued an opinion to the effect that state lottery ticket sales over the internet to in-state
adults do not violate the Wire Act. The opinion may provide an impetus for states to authorize internet or other forms of interactive gaming in order to create an additional revenue stream. However,
as a general matter, we believe states will be required or otherwise deem it advisable to enact enabling legislation or new regulations addressing the sale of lottery tickets or the offering of other
forms of gaming over the internet. The enactment of internet gaming legislation that federalizes significant aspects of the regulation of internet gaming could have an adverse impact on our ability to
pursue our interactive strategy in the U.S. Internationally, laws relating to internet gaming are evolving, particularly in Europe. To varying degrees, a number of European governments have taken
steps to change the regulation of internet wagering through the 
 implementation
of new or revised licensing and taxation regimes, including the possible imposition of sanctions on unlicensed providers. We cannot predict the timing, scope or terms of any such state,
federal or foreign laws and regulations, or the extent to which any such legislation will facilitate or hinder our interactive strategy. 
 In
jurisdictions that authorize internet gaming, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in selling our technology, content and services to internet gaming operators as we
expect to face intense competition from our traditional competitors in the lottery business as well as a number of other domestic and foreign providers (or the operators themselves), some of which
have substantially greater financial resources and/or experience in this area than we do. In addition, there is a risk that the authorization of the sale of lottery tickets or games or other forms of
gaming via the internet in a particular jurisdiction could, under certain circumstances, adversely impact our revenue relating to sales of lottery products through traditional channels in such
jurisdiction. Any such adverse impact would be magnified to the extent we are not involved in and generating revenue from, the provision of products or services for internet gaming in such
jurisdiction. 
 Our
ability to compete effectively in the internet gaming space will depend on the acceptance by our customers of the products and services we offer. Such products and services may rely
on technology that we acquire or license from third parties. On January 23, 2012, we entered into an agreement with Playtech that restructured our strategic relationship relating to internet
and gaming products and services. Under the agreement, Playtech will license its internet gaming software to us on a mutually non-exclusive basis for use by certain categories of our
current and prospective customers, including U.S. casinos and lotteries worldwide. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop and market internet gaming solutions under our
new agreement with Playtech or otherwise. Our performance under any arrangement with a customer that contemplates the customer's use of Playtech's software will be dependent to some extent on
Playtech's performance and reliability. We will be required to share with Playtech a significant portion of our revenue from any such offering in the form of a license fee. 
 We
are also internally developing potential internet gaming solutions for our customers. Such internal development is costly and there can be no assurance that such development will
result in commercially viable products. In addition, there can be no assurance that our internally developed products will not infringe upon the proprietary rights of others, or that other parties
will not assert infringement claims against us. 
 We are heavily dependent on our ability to renew our long-term contracts with our customers and we could lose substantial revenue and profits if we are unable to
renew certain of our contracts. 
 Generally, our customer contracts contain initial multi-year terms, with optional renewal periods held by the customer.
Upon the expiration of a contract, including any extensions thereof, new contracts may be awarded through a competitive bidding process. 
 Since
late 2007, we have lost lottery systems contracts in South Carolina, West Virginia, South Dakota, New Hampshire and Vermont to our competitors following the expiration of our
contracts. During 2010, the lottery authority in Maine awarded a new lottery contract to one of our competitors, which award was subsequently invalidated as a result of our protest. The competitor's
appeal of the protest ruling was denied on October 21, 2011. Our contract with Maine was extended for one year beyond its expiration until June 30, 2012 pending further action by the
Maine lottery authority. 
 We
are also required by certain of our lottery customers to provide surety or performance bonds in connection with our contracts. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately
$206.9 million of outstanding surety and performance bonds. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain surety or performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms or
at all. Our inability to 
 provide
such bonds would materially and adversely affect our ability to renew existing, or obtain new lottery contracts. 
 In
our U.K. gaming business, William Hill, a U.K. bookmaker, recently awarded a contract to one of our principal competitors (currently the supplier for a majority of gaming machines for
William Hill) for the sole supply of gaming machines to William Hill following the expiration of our gaming machine supply contract with William Hill in March 2012. 
 There
can be no assurance that our current contracts will be extended or that we will be awarded new contracts as a result of competitive bidding processes or otherwise in the future.
The termination, expiration or failure to renew one or more of our contracts could cause us to lose substantial revenues and profits, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to win or renew
other contracts or pursue acquisitions or other growth initiatives. For additional information regarding the potential expiration dates of certain other contracts, see the table in
"BusinessContract Procurement" in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 We may not have sufficient cash flows from operating activities, cash on hand and available borrowings under our credit facilities to finance required capital expenditures
under new contracts, service our indebtedness and meet our other cash needs. These obligations require a significant amount of cash. 
 Our lottery systems and gaming machine businesses generally require significant upfront capital expenditures for terminal assembly,
software customization and implementation, systems and equipment installation and telecommunications configuration. In connection with a renewal or re-bid of a lottery systems or gaming machine
contract, a customer may seek to obtain new equipment or impose new service requirements, which may require additional capital expenditures in order to retain the contract. Historically, we have
funded these upfront costs through cash flows generated from operations, available cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facilities. Our ability to generate revenue and to continue to procure
new contracts will depend on, among other things, our then present liquidity levels or our ability to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms. 
 If
we do not have adequate liquidity or are unable to obtain financing for these upfront costs on favorable terms or at all, we may not be able to bid on certain contracts, which could
restrict our ability to grow and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Moreover, we may not realize the return on investment that we anticipate on new or renewed contracts due
to a variety of factors, including lower than anticipated retail sales, higher than anticipated capital or operating expenses and unanticipated regulatory developments or litigation. We may not have
adequate liquidity to pursue
other aspects of our strategy, including bringing our products and services to new customers or new or underpenetrated geographies (including through equity investments) or pursuing strategic
acquisitions. 
 As
of December 31, 2011, we had total indebtedness of approximately $1,390.7 million, or approximately 75.8% of our total capitalization, consisting primarily of senior
secured term loan and revolving credit facilities under our credit agreement and senior subordinated notes. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability
to generate cash in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Our lenders,
including the lenders participating in our revolving credit facilities, may have suffered losses related to their lending and other financial relationships, especially because of the general weakening
of the national and global economy and increased financial instability of many borrowers. As a result, lenders may become insolvent or tighten their lending standards, which could make it more
difficult for us to borrow under our revolving credit facilities or to obtain other financing on favorable terms or at all. Our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely
affected if we were unable to draw funds under our revolving credit facilities because of a lender default or to obtain other cost-effective financing. Any default by a lender 
 in
its obligation to fund its commitment under our revolving credit facilities (or its participation in letters of credit) could limit our liquidity to the extent of the defaulting lender's
commitment. 
 If
we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to meet our commitments, we will be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as refinancing or
restructuring our indebtedness, selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital. We cannot assure you that any of these actions could be completed on a
timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all, or that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements. Moreover, our existing debt agreements contain, and our future
debt agreements may contain, restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not
cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt. 
 Our credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes impose certain restrictions. Failure to comply with any of these restrictions could result
in the acceleration of the maturity of our indebtedness. Were this to occur, we would not have sufficient cash to pay our accelerated indebtedness. 
 The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements, including our credit agreement and the indentures
governing our senior subordinated notes may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in new business activities. Our credit facilities and/or indentures
restrict our ability to, among other things: 
 In
addition, our credit agreement require us to maintain certain financial ratios. As a result of these covenants, we will be limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business,
and may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. A failure to comply with the restrictions contained in our credit agreement or indentures,
or to maintain the financial ratios required by our credit agreement, could lead to an event of default which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness. See Note 8
(Long-Term and Other Debt) to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these financial ratios. 
 There
can be no assurance that our future operating results will be sufficient to ensure compliance with the covenants in our credit agreement, indentures or other debt instruments or to
remedy any such default. In addition, in the event of acceleration, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make any accelerated payments. 
 Our business depends on the protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information. 
 We believe that our success depends, in part, on protecting our intellectual property in the U.S. and in foreign countries. Our
intellectual property includes certain patents and trademarks relating to our instant ticket games and wagering systems, as well as proprietary or confidential information that is not subject to
patent or similar protection. Our intellectual property protects the integrity of our games, systems, products and services, which is a core value of our business. For example, our intellectual
property is designed to ensure the security of the printing of our instant lottery tickets and provide simple and secure validation of our lottery tickets. Competitors may independently develop
similar or superior products, software, systems or business models. In cases where our intellectual property is not protected by an enforceable patent, such independent development may result in a
significant diminution in the value of our intellectual property. 
 There
can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our intellectual property. We enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, vendors, consultants and, to
the extent legally permissible, our customers, and generally control access to, and the distribution of, our game designs, systems and other software documentation and proprietary information, as well
as the designs, systems and other software documentation and information that we license from others. Despite our efforts to protect these proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may try to copy our
gaming products, business models or systems, use certain of our confidential information to develop competing products, or develop independently or otherwise obtain and use our gaming products or
technology, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and expensive, particularly because of the global nature of our
operations. The laws of other countries may not adequately protect our intellectual property. 
 There
can be no assurance that our business activities, games, products and systems will not infringe upon the proprietary rights of others, or that other parties will not assert
infringement claims (with or without merit) against us. Any such claim and any resulting litigation, should it occur, could subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in
invalidation of our proprietary rights, distract management, and/or require us to enter into costly and burdensome royalty and licensing agreements. Such royalty and licensing agreements, if required,
may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or may not be available at all. In the future, we may also need to file or respond to lawsuits to defend the validity of our intellectual property
rights and trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and
diversion of resources. 
 We
rely on products and technologies that we license from third parties. There can be no assurance that these third-party licenses, or the support for such licenses, will continue to be
available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. 
 Our business competes on the basis of the security and integrity of our systems and products. 
 We believe that our success depends, in part, on providing secure products and systems to our customers. Attempts to penetrate security
measures may come from various combinations of customers, retailers, vendors, employees and others. Our ability to monitor and ensure the quality of our products is periodically reviewed and enhanced.
Similarly, we regularly assess the adequacy of our security systems to protect against any material loss to any of our customers and the integrity of our products to end-users. Expanded
utilization of the internet and other interactive technologies may result in increased security concerns for us and our customers. There can
be no assurance that our business will not be affected by a security breach or lapse, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, business and/or prospects. 
 Our industry is subject to strict government regulations that may limit our existing operations and have an adverse impact on our ability to grow. 
 In the U.S. and many other countries, lotteries and other forms of gaming is subject to extensive and evolving regulation. Such gaming
regulatory requirements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Therefore, we are subject to a wide range of complex gaming laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we are licensed or
operate. Most jurisdictions require that we be licensed, that our key personnel and certain of our security holders be found suitable or be licensed, and that our products be reviewed and approved
before placement. If a license, approval or finding of suitability is required by a regulatory authority and we fail to seek or do not receive the necessary approval, license or finding of
suitability, then we may be prohibited from providing our products or services for use in the particular jurisdiction. 
 The
regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future, and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business or
prospects. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the operation of lotteries, video gaming machines, internet gaming or other forms of lottery or gaming will be approved by additional jurisdictions
or that those jurisdictions in which these activities are currently permitted will continue to permit such activities. Laws and regulations relating to internet and other form of interactive gaming
are evolving. For additional discussion regarding risks associated with the evolving interactive gaming regulatory landscape, see the risk factor above captioned "We may not be able
capitalize on the expansion of internet or other forms of interactive gaming or other trends and changes in the lottery and gaming industries." 
 There
can be no assurance that law enforcement or gaming regulatory authorities will not seek to restrict our business in their jurisdictions or even institute enforcement proceedings.
In addition, there can be no assurance that any instituted enforcement proceedings will be favorably resolved, or that such proceedings will not have a material adverse impact on our ability to retain
and renew existing licenses or to obtain new licenses in other jurisdictions. 
 Moreover,
in addition to the risk of an enforcement action, we also potentially risk an impact on our reputation in the event of any potential legal or regulatory investigation whether
or not we are ultimately accused of or found to have committed any violation. We are required to obtain and maintain licenses from various jurisdictions in order to operate certain aspects of our
business and we are subject to extensive background investigations and suitability standards in our business. We also will become subject to regulation in any other jurisdiction in which our customers
operate in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain new licenses or renew any of our existing licenses, or that if such licenses are obtained, that such licenses will not
be conditioned, suspended or revoked, and the loss, denial or non-renewal of any of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business or prospects.
Lottery authorities generally conduct
background investigations of the winning vendor and its employees prior to and after the award of a lottery 
 contract.
Generally, regulatory authorities have broad discretion when granting, renewing or revoking these approvals and licenses. Lottery authorities with which we do business may require the
removal of any of our employees deemed to be unsuitable and are generally empowered to disqualify us from receiving a lottery contract or operating a lottery system as a result of any such
investigation. Our failure, or the failure of any of our key personnel, systems or machines, in obtaining or retaining a required license or approval in one jurisdiction could negatively impact our
ability (or the ability of any of our key personnel, systems or gaming machines) to obtain or retain required licenses and approvals in other jurisdictions. The failure to obtain or retain a required
license or approval in any jurisdiction would decrease the geographic areas where we may operate and generate revenues, decrease our share in the lottery or gaming industry and put us at a
disadvantage relative to our competitors. 
 Some
jurisdictions also require extensive personal and financial disclosure and background checks from persons and entities beneficially owning a specified percentage (typically 5% or
more) of our equity securities. The failure of these beneficial owners to submit to such background checks and provide required disclosure could jeopardize the award of a contract to us or provide
grounds for termination of an existing contract. Additional restrictions are often imposed on foreign entities such as us by international jurisdictions in which we seek to market our products or
services. In light of these regulations and the potential impact on our business, our restated certificate of incorporation allows for the restriction of stock ownership by persons or entities who
fail to comply with informational or other regulatory requirements under applicable gaming laws, who are found unsuitable to hold our stock by gaming authorities or whose stock ownership adversely
affects our ability to obtain, maintain, renew or qualify for a license, contract, franchise or other regulatory approval from a gaming authority. The licensing procedures and background
investigations of the authorities that regulate our businesses and the restriction in our certificate of incorporation may inhibit potential investors from becoming significant stockholders or inhibit
existing stockholders from retaining or increasing their ownership. 
 We
have developed and implemented an internal compliance program in an effort to ensure that we comply with legal requirements imposed in connection with our gaming-related activities,
as well as legal requirements generally applicable to all publicly traded corporations. The compliance program is run on a day-to-day basis by our Chief Compliance Officer with
legal advice provided by our legal department and outside experts. The compliance program is overseen by the Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors, consisting entirely of outside directors.
There can be no assurance that such steps will prevent the violation of one or more laws or regulations, or that a violation by us or an employee will not result in the imposition of a monetary fine
or suspension or revocation of one or more of our licenses. 
 Gaming opponents persist in their efforts to curtail the expansion of legalized gaming, which, if successful, could limit the growth of our operations. 
 Legalized gaming is subject to opposition from gaming opponents. There can be no assurance that this opposition will not succeed in
preventing the legalization of gaming in jurisdictions where these activities are presently prohibited or prohibiting or limiting the expansion of gaming where it is currently permitted, in either
case to the detriment of our business, financial condition, results and prospects. 
 We may not succeed in realizing the anticipated benefits of our strategic equity investments and relationships. 
 Under certain circumstances we pursue growth through strategic equity investments, including joint ventures, as a means to, among other
things, gain access to new and tactically important geographies, business opportunities and technical expertise, while simultaneously offering the potential for reducing capital requirements. 
 These
strategic equity investments currently include investments in LNS, Northstar, Sportech, RCN and our equity investments in China. We are party to strategic agreements with Playtech
relating to gaming machines that contemplate our use of and reliance on Playtech's back-end technology platform in international jurisdictions. In 2011, Global Draw completed the migration
of its server-based gaming machines to this back-end technology platform in the U.K. and began migrating server-based gaming machines outside the U.K. to this technology during the third
quarter of 2011. 
 As
of December 31, 2011, we owned a 50% interest in Sciplay with Playtech to deliver internet gaming solutions to government-sponsored and government-regulated lotteries and
certain other gaming operators. Sciplay was formed to capitalize on the combination of Playtech's internet gaming software and content and our experience and relationships with lotteries and other
gaming operators. On January 23, 2012, we entered into an agreement with Playtech that restructured this strategic relationship from a joint venture arrangement to a license arrangement. Under
the agreement, Playtech will license its internet gaming software to us on a mutually non-exclusive basis for use by certain categories of our current and prospective customers, including
U.S. casinos and lotteries worldwide. The Sciplay-related entities are now wholly owned subsidiaries of Scientific Games. There
can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop and market internet gaming solutions under our restructured arrangement with Playtech. 
 Northstar,
in which we are a 20% equity holder, was awarded the agreement to be the private manager for the Illinois Lottery for a ten-year term following a competitive
procurement process, which agreement was executed on January 18, 2011. See "BusinessOperational OverviewPrinted ProductsNorthstar" in Item 1 of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K. On January 26, 2011, the Illinois Appellate Court upheld a constitutional challenge to the revenue statute that, among other things, amended
the Illinois lottery law to facilitate the PMA, on grounds that the statute impermissibly addressed more than one subject. On July 11, 2011, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed the Appellate
Court decision and upheld the revenue statute. Operations under the PMA commenced on July 1, 2011. Under the terms of the PMA, Northstar is entitled to receive annual incentive compensation
payments from Illinois to the extent it is successful in increasing the lottery's net income above specified target levels of lottery net income, subject to a cap of 5% of the applicable year's net
income. Northstar will be responsible for payments to Illinois to the extent the lottery net income levels set forth in Northstar's successful bid are not achieved, subject to a similar cap. The
lottery net income levels set forth in Northstar's successful bid were $851.1 million, $950 million, $980 million, $986 million and $1 billion for the five fiscal
years ending June 30, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, representing a compound annual growth rate in lottery net income of approximately 44%, including an approximate 27% increase
in lottery net income in the first year. These net income target levels are subject to upward or downward adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the PMA. 
 We
may not realize the anticipated benefits of these strategic equity investments and other strategic relationships that we may enter into, or may not realize them in the timeframe
expected. These arrangements pose significant risks that could have a negative effect on our operations, including: the potential diversion of our management's attention from our core business to, for
example, integrate technologies; the potential failure to realize anticipated synergies, economies of scale or other value associated with the arrangements; unanticipated costs and other unanticipated
events or circumstances; possible adverse effects on our operating results during any integration process; impairment charges if our strategic equity investments or relationships are not as successful
as we originally anticipate; and our potential inability to achieve the intended objectives of the arrangements. 
 Furthermore,
our strategic equity investment and other strategic relationships pose risks arising from our reliance on our partners and our lack of sole decision-making authority, which
may give rise to disputes between us and our partners. For instance, our investment in LNS is a minority investment in a venture whose largest equity holder is Lottomatica, the parent company of one
of our principal 
 competitors,
and, although certain corporate actions require our prior consent, we do not control decisions relating to the governance of LNS. Our partners may have economic or business interests or
goals that are inconsistent with our interests and goals, take actions contrary to our objectives or policies, undergo a change of control, experience financial and other difficulties or be unable or
unwilling to fulfill their obligations under our arrangements. 
 The
failure to avoid or mitigate the risks described above or other risks associated with such arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. 
 We may be required to recognize additional impairment charges. 
 We assess our goodwill and other intangible assets and our long-lived assets as and when required by accounting principles
generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP") to determine whether they are impaired. We recorded accelerated depreciation expense of $6.4 million and $8.3 million in 2011 and 2010,
respectively, as a result of Global Draw's migration to a new platform technology. In 2010, we recorded asset impairment charges of approximately $17.5 million related to underperforming
Lottery Systems contracts, $3.0 million of impairments related to obsolete equipment in Lottery Systems and $2.5 million of impairments related to obsolete equipment in Global Draw. In
2009, we recorded asset impairment charges of approximately $24.7 million primarily related to underperforming Lottery Systems contracts. Refer to the heading "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting PoliciesValuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill" in Item 7
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1 (Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 4 (Property and Equipment) to our Consolidated
Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We cannot predict the occurrence of impairments and there can be no assurance that we will not have to record additional
impairment charges in the future. 
 Our inability to complete future acquisitions of gaming and related businesses and integrate those businesses successfully could limit our future growth. 
 Part of our corporate strategy is to continue to pursue expansion and strategic acquisition opportunities. In connection with any such
acquisitions, we could face significant challenges in managing and integrating the expanded or combined operations, including acquired assets, operations and personnel. There can be no assurance that
acquisition opportunities will be available on acceptable terms or at all or that we will be able to obtain necessary financing or regulatory approvals to complete potential acquisitions. Our ability
to succeed in implementing our strategy will depend to some degree upon the ability of our management to identify, complete and successfully integrate commercially viable acquisitions. Acquisition
transactions may disrupt our ongoing business and distract management from other responsibilities. 
 Our revenues fluctuate due to seasonality and timing of equipment sales and, therefore, our periodic operating results are not guarantees of future performance. 
 Our revenues can fluctuate due to seasonality in some components of our business. The summer season historically has been the weakest
part of the year for certain parts of our lottery business, particularly where our revenues are tied to a percentage of retail sales under our CSP or POS contracts. The third quarter is typically the
weakest quarter for Global Draw, which could adversely affect the amounts wagered and our corresponding service revenue. 
 In
addition, our revenue from Lottery Systems can be somewhat dependent on the size of jackpots of lottery games such as Powerball and Mega Millions during the relevant period. 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to develop, enhance and/or introduce successful gaming concepts and game content. 
 Lottery and gaming equipment sales and software license revenue usually reflects a limited number of large transactions, which may not
recur on an annual basis. Consequently, revenue and operating margins can vary substantially from period to period as a result of the timing and magnitude of major equipment sales and software license
revenue. As a general matter, lottery and gaming equipment sales generate lower operating margins than revenue from other aspects of our business. In addition, instant ticket sales may vary depending
on the season and timing of contract awards, changes in customer budgets, ticket inventory levels, lottery retail sales and general economic conditions. 
 Our
Global Draw, Games Media and Barcrest businesses develop and source game content both internally and through third-party suppliers. Games Media and Barcrest also seek to secure
third-party brands for incorporation into its game content. We believe creative and appealing game content produces more revenue and net win for the gaming machine customers of these businesses and
provides them with a competitive advantage, which in turn enhances the revenues of Global Draw, Games Media and Barcrest and their ability to attract new business or to retain existing business. In
our lottery business, we believe that innovative gaming concepts and game content, such as multiplier games from Lottery Systems and licensed brand game content from Printed Products, can enhance the
revenue of our lottery customers and distinguish us from our competitors. There can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain the success of our existing game content or effectively develop or
obtain
from third parties new or enhanced game content that will be widely accepted both by our customers and their end users. 
 We are dependent on our suppliers and contract manufacturers, and any failure of these parties to meet our performance and quality standards or requirements could cause us
to incur additional costs or lose customers. 
 Our production of instant lottery tickets, in particular, depends upon a continuous supply of raw materials, supplies, power and
natural resources. Our operating results could be adversely affected by an interruption or cessation in the supply of these items or a serious quality assurance lapse, including as a result of the
insolvency of any of our key suppliers. 
 Similarly,
production of our presses and lottery and gaming systems is dependent upon a regular and continuous supply of components many of which are manufactured outside of the United
States. The assembly of many of our terminals and other hardware is performed by third parties. Any interruption or cessation in the supply of these items or services or any material quality assurance
lapse with respect thereto could materially adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer orders, our financial condition or our results of operations. 
 We
transmit certain wagering data utilizing satellite transponders, generally pursuant to long-term contracts. The technical failure of any of these satellites would require
us to obtain other communication services, including other satellite access. In some cases, we employ backup systems to limit our exposure in the event of such a failure. There can be no assurance of
access to such other satellites or, if available, the ability to obtain the use of such other satellites on favorable terms or in a timely manner. While satellite failures are infrequent, the
operation of satellites is outside of our control. 
 In
addition, our gaming businesses include a number of significant contracts whose performance depends upon our third-party suppliers delivering equipment on schedule in order to meet
our contract commitments. Failure of the suppliers to meet their delivery commitments could result in us being in breach of, and subsequently losing, those contracts, which loss could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 We may be liable for product defects or other claims relating to our products. 
 Our products could be defective, fail to perform as designed or otherwise cause harm to our customers, their equipment or their
products. If any of our products are defective, we may be required to recall the products and/or repair or replace them, which could result in substantial expenses and affect our profitability. Any
problems with the performance of our products, such as an instant ticket misprint, could harm our reputation, which could result in a loss of sales to customers and/or potential customers. In
addition, if our customers believe that they have suffered harm caused by our products, they could bring claims against us that could result in significant liability. Any claims brought against us by
customers may result in diversion of management's time and attention, expenditure of large amounts of cash on legal fees, expenses and payment of damages, decreased demand for our products or
services, or injury to our reputation. Our insurance may not sufficiently cover a large judgment against us or a large settlement payment, and is subject to customary deductibles, limits and
exclusions. 
 We have foreign operations, which subjects us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and other risks. 
 We are a global business and derive a substantial and growing portion of our revenue and profits from operations outside the United
States. In the year ended December 31, 2011, we derived approximately 52% of our revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States. 
 Our
consolidated financial results are significantly affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange rate exposures arise from current transactions and
anticipated transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars and from the translation of foreign currency balance sheet accounts into U.S. dollar-denominated balance sheet accounts. We
are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations because a significant portion of our revenue is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, particularly the British Pound Sterling and the
Euro. In particular, uncertainty regarding economic conditions in the Europe and the debt crisis affecting certain countries in the European Union poses risk to the stability of the Euro. Exchange
rate fluctuations have in the past adversely affected our operating results and cash flows and may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows and the value of our assets outside the
U.S. in the future. 
 In
January 2012, we entered into foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional value of €23.5 million to hedge a portion of our net investment in
certain of our subsidiaries that is denominated in Euros. As a result, the Company is subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these contracts defaults on its performance under the
contracts. During an economic downturn, the counterparty's financial condition may deteriorate rapidly and with little notice and we may be unable to take action to protect our exposure. In the event
of a counterparty default, we could incur losses, which may harm our business and financial condition. In the event that one or more of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy,
our ability to eventually
recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty's default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty. 
 Our
operations in foreign jurisdictions subject us to additional risks customarily associated with such operations, including: 
 Additionally,
foreign taxes paid by our foreign subsidiaries and equity investees on their earnings may not be recovered against our U.S. tax liability. At December 31, 2011, we
had a deferred tax asset for our foreign tax credit ("FTC") carry forward of approximately $30.1 million. Although we will continue to explore tax planning strategies to use all of our FTC, at
December 31, 2011, we established 
 a
valuation allowance of approximately $30.1 million against the FTC deferred tax asset to reduce the asset to the net amount that our management estimates is "more likely than not" to be
realized. 
 In
addition, our ability to expand successfully in foreign jurisdictions involves other risks, including difficulties in integrating foreign operations, risks associated with entering
jurisdictions in which we may have little experience and the day-to-day management of a growing and increasingly geographically diverse company. Our investment in foreign
jurisdictions often entails entering into joint ventures or other business relationships with locally based entities, which can involve additional risks arising from our lack of sole decision-making
authority, our reliance on a partner's financial condition, inconsistency between our business interests or goals and those of our partners and disputes between us and our partners. 
 Through
our joint ventures and wholly owned foreign enterprises, we have lottery-related investments and business operations in China, from which we expect to derive a growing portion of
income. Our business in, and results of operations from, China are subject to a number of risks, including risks relating to competition in China, our ability to finance or refinance our operations in
China, the complex regulatory environment in China, the political climate in China, the Chinese economy and our joint venture and other business partners in China. Our joint ventures in China are with
locally based state-owned enterprises, which can potentially heighten the joint venture-related risks described above relating to inconsistency of business interests and disputes. 
 We
anticipate that continued lottery-related growth in China depends in part on sustained demand for lottery tickets at higher price points, as well as continued expansion of the
retailer network, optimization of retailer inventories and other growth initiatives. There can be no assurance that lottery ticket demand will be sustained at higher price points, and we cannot
predict the rate of retailer expansion, the extent of inventory optimization or the success of our other growth initiatives. 
 There
can be no assurance that legal and regulatory requirements in China will not change or that China's central or local governments will not impose new, stricter regulations or
interpretations of existing regulations that would impose additional costs on our operations in China or even restrict or prohibit such operations. For example, comprehensive legislation regulating
competition took effect on August 1, 2008. This law, among other things, prohibits certain types of agreements (unless they fall within specified exemptions) and certain behavior classified as
abuse of dominant market position or intellectual property rights. Additionally, new lottery regulations providing for enhanced supervision of the lottery industry in China became effective on
July 1, 2009. We cannot predict with certainty what impact these laws and regulations or any future laws and regulations (or implementing rules or enforcement policies relating to any of the
foregoing) will have on our business in China. 
 We
may not realize the operating efficiencies, competitive position or financial results that we anticipate from our investments in foreign jurisdictions and our failure to effectively
manage the risks associated with our operations in foreign jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business or prospects. 
 Certain holders of our common stock exert significant influence over the Company and may make decisions with which other stockholders may disagree. 
 In August 2004, MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc. was issued approximately 25% of our outstanding common stock in
connection with its conversion of our then outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. According to an amendment to Schedule 13D filed with the SEC on June 16, 2011, this
holder beneficially owns 31,700,737 shares of our common stock, or approximately 34.4% of our currently outstanding common stock. Pursuant to a stockholders' agreement with us, which we originally
entered into with holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, such holder is entitled to appoint up to four member of our Board of Directors and certain actions of the Company require
the approval of such holder. As a result, this holder has the ability to exert significant influence 
 over
our business and may make decisions with which other stockholders may disagree, including, among other things, delaying, discouraging or preventing a change of control of the Company or a
potential merger, consolidation, tender offer, takeover or other business combination. 
 If certain of our key personnel leave us, our business will be significantly adversely affected. 
 We depend on the continued performance of A. Lorne Weil, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Michael Chambrello, our Chief
Executive OfficerAsia-Pacific Region, as well as the other members of our senior management team. Messrs. Weil and Chambrello have extensive experience in the lottery
and gaming industries and have contributed significantly to the growth of our business. We rely on Mr. Weil's overall strategic vision and his direction on business development projects,
including mergers and acquisitions. We rely on Mr. Chambrello to maintain and grow our China business. If we lose the services of them or any of our other senior officers and cannot find
suitable replacements for such persons in a timely manner, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Mr. Weil has an employment agreement that is scheduled to expire at the end
of 2015. Mr. Chambrello has an employment agreement that is scheduled to expire at the end of 2013. 
 We could incur costs in the event of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws. 
 Our operations and real property are subject to U.S. and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air
emissions, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur costs, including cleanup costs, fines or penalties, and third-party
claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws. Some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent or reduce environmental pollution, and these
permits are subject to review, renewal and modification by issuing authorities. 
 Failure to perform under our lottery contracts may result in litigation, substantial monetary liquidated damages and contract termination. 
 Our business subjects us to contract penalties and risks of litigation, including due to potential allegations that we have not fully
performed under our contracts or that goods or services we supply are defective in some respect. Litigation is pending in Colombia arising out of the termination of certain Colombian lottery contracts
in 1993. An agency of the Colombian government has asserted claims against certain parties, including our subsidiary, SGI, which owned a minority interest in Wintech de Colombia S.A., or
Wintech (now liquidated), the former operator of the Colombian national lottery. The claims are for, among other things, contract penalties, interest and the costs of a bond issued by a Colombian
surety. For additional information regarding this litigation, see "Legal Proceedings" in Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There can be no assurance that this
litigation will not be finally resolved adversely to us or result in material liability. 
 In
addition, our lottery contracts typically permit a lottery authority to terminate the contract at any time for material failure to perform, other specified reasons and, in many cases,
for no reason at all. Lottery contracts to which we are a party also frequently contain exacting implementation schedules and performance requirements and the failure to meet these schedules and
requirements may result in substantial monetary liquidated damages, as well as possible contract termination. We are also required by certain of our lottery customers to provide surety or performance
bonds. We have paid or incurred liquidated damages under our lottery contracts and material amounts of liquidated damages could be imposed on us in the future, which could, if imposed, have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, business or prospects. 
 Labor disputes may have an adverse effect on our operations. 
 Certain of our employees are represented by unions, including employees at our printing facilities in Australia, Canada, Chile and the
United Kingdom. There can be no assurance that we will not encounter any conflicts or strikes with any labor union that represents our employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business or
results of operations, could cause us to lose customers or could cause our customers' operations to be affected and might have permanent effects on our business. 
 The price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile 
 Our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as, variations in operating results, actions by
various regulatory agencies, litigation, financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, rating agency reports, performance of other companies that investors or security analysts deem
comparable to us, news reports relating to our business, our markets and general market conditions. During the 52-week period ended February 24, 2012, our stock price fluctuated
between a high of $13.08 and a low of $6.50. This significant stock price fluctuation may make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their common stock when they want and at prices they find
attractive.
