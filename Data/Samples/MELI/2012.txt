RISK FACTORS 
 For
purposes of this section, the term stockholders means the holders of shares of our common stock. Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our stockholders and prospective stockholders. You should carefully consider
the following factors in evaluating our company, our properties and our business. The occurrence of any of the following risks might cause our stockholders to lose all or a part of their investment in our Company. The risks and uncertainties
described below are not the only ones facing us. Other risks that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations and financial condition. Some statements in this report including
statements in the following risk factors section constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section entitled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the beginning of this report. 
 Risks related to our business 
 The
market for the sale of goods over the Internet in Latin America is developing, and our business depends on the continued growth of online commerce and the availability and suitability of the Internet in Latin America. 
 The market for the sale of goods over the Internet is a new and emerging market in Latin America. Our future revenues depend substantially
on Latin American consumers widespread acceptance and use of the Internet as a way to conduct commerce. Rapid growth in the use of and interest in the Internet (particularly as a way to conduct commerce) is a recent phenomenon, and we cannot
assure you that this acceptance and use will continue to exist or develop. For us to grow our user base successfully, consumers who have historically used traditional means of commerce to purchase goods and services must accept and use new ways of
conducting business and exchanging information. Furthermore, the price of personal computers and Internet access may limit our potential growth in countries with low levels of Internet penetration and/or high levels of poverty. 
 In addition, the Internet may not be commercially viable in Latin America in the long term for a number of reasons, including potentially
inadequate development of the necessary network infrastructure or delayed development of enabling technologies, performance improvements and security measures. The infrastructure for the Internet may not be able to support continued growth in the
number of Internet users, their frequency of use or their bandwidth requirements. In addition, the Internet could lose its viability due to delays in telecommunications technological developments, or due to increased government regulation. If
telecommunications services change or are not sufficiently available to support the Internet, response times would be slower, which would adversely affect use of the Internet and our service in particular. 
 Our future success depends on our ability to expand and adapt our operations to meet rapidly changing industry and technology standards in a
cost-effective and timely manner, and on the continued market acceptance of our products and services. 
 We plan to
continue to expand our operations by developing and promoting new and complementary services. We may not succeed at expanding our operations in a cost-effective or timely manner, and our expansion efforts may not have the same or greater overall
market acceptance as our current services. Furthermore, any new business or service that we launch that is not favorably received by consumers could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brands. To expand our operations we will also
need to spend significant amounts on development, operations and other resources, and we may place a strain on our management, financial and operational resources as a result. Similarly, a lack of market acceptance of these services or our inability
to generate satisfactory revenues from any expanded services to offset their cost could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Any delay or problem with upgrading our existing information technology infrastructure could cause a disruption in our business and adversely impact our financial results. 
 Our ability to operate our business on a day-to-day basis largely depends on the efficient operation of our information technology
infrastructure. We are frequently implementing hardware and software technology upgrades, which may include migrations to new technology systems, in an effort to improve our systems. Our information technology systems may experience errors,
interruptions, delays or cessations of service. We are particularly susceptible to errors in connection with any systems upgrade or migration to a different hardware or software system. Errors or interruptions could impede or delay our ability to
process transactions on our site, which could reduce our revenue from activity on our site and adversely affect our reputation with, or result in the loss of users. These issues could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming,
and resource intensive than anticipated. Defects or disruptions in our technology infrastructure could adversely impact our ability to process transactions, our financial results and our reputation. 
 Internet regulation in the countries where we operate is scarce, and several legal issues related to
the Internet are uncertain. We are subject to a number of other laws and regulations, and governments may enact laws or regulations that could adversely affect our business. 
 Unlike the United States, most of the countries where we operate do not have specific laws governing the liability of Internet service
providers, such as ourselves, for fraud, intellectual property infringement, other illegal activities committed by individual users or third-party infringing content hosted on a providers servers. This legal uncertainty allows for different
judges or courts to decide very similar claims in different ways and establish contradictory jurisprudence. For example, in June 2009, a judge of a first instance court in the State of São Paulo ruled that our Brazilian subsidiary should
be held liable for fraud committed by sellers and losses incurred by buyers when purchasing items on the Brazilian version of the MercadoLibre website. We are appealing this ruling and, in December 2009, the effect of the ruling was suspended
until the appeal is decided by State Court of Appeals. If the ruling is upheld, it could require us to restructure our business model in ways that would harm our business and or cause us to incur substantial costs. 
 In addition, certain judges may decide that Internet service providers are liable to an intellectual property owner for a users
sale of counterfeit items using our platform, while others may decide that the responsibility lies solely with the offending user. This legal uncertainty allows for rulings against us and could set adverse precedents, which individually or in the
aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, legal uncertainty may negatively affect our clients perception and use of our services. 
 We are subject to a variety of laws, decrees and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet in some of the
countries where we operate related to e-commerce, information requirements for Internet providers, data collection, data protection, privacy, anti-money laundering, taxation (including VAT or sales tax collection obligations), obligations to provide
certain information to certain authorities about transactions which through our platforms or about our users and those regulations applicable to businesses in general and consumer protection. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such
as general commercial activities, property ownership, copyrights and other intellectual property issues, taxation (including taxation to provide certain information about transactions that consummated through our platforms or about our users), libel
and defamation, obscenity, and personal privacy apply to online businesses. Many of these laws were adopted before the Internet was available and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet. Due to these areas of
legal uncertainty, and the increasing popularity and use of the Internet and other online services, it is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted with respect to the Internet or other online services. These laws and regulations could
cover issues such as online commerce, Internet service providers responsibility for third party content hosted in their servers, user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, content and quality of products and services, taxation (including
VAT or sales tax collection obligations, obligations to provide certain information about transactions occurred in our platforms or about our users), advertising, intellectual property rights, consumer protection, information security and electronic
and mobile payments. If laws relating to these issues are enacted, they may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. 
 As our activities and the types of goods listed on our web site expand, regulatory agencies or courts may argue or rule that we or our users must either obtain licenses or not be allowed to conduct
business in their jurisdiction, either with respect to our services in general or only relating to certain items, such as auctions, real estate and motor vehicles. For example, numerous jurisdictions, including Brazil and Argentina, have regulations
regarding auctions and auctioneers and the handling of property by secondhand dealers or pawnbrokers. Attempted enforcement of these laws against us or our users and other regulatory and licensing
claims could result in expensive litigation or could require us to change the way we or our users do business. Any changes in our or our users business methods could increase costs or reduce revenues or force us to prohibit listings of certain
items for some locations. We could also be subject to fines or penalties, and any of these outcomes could harm our business. 
 In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods to users worldwide, other foreign
jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws. As we expand and localize our international activities, we have to comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate. Laws regulating Internet companies outside of the
Latin American jurisdictions where we operate may be more restrictive to us than those in Latin America. In order to comply with these laws, we may have to change our business practices or restrict our services. We could be subject to penalties
ranging from criminal prosecution to bans on our services for failure to comply with foreign laws. 
 We are subject to laws
relating to the collection, use, storage and transfer of personally identifiable information about our users, especially financial information. Several jurisdictions have regulations in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing
additional restrictions or regulations. If we violate these laws, which in many cases apply not only to third-party transactions but also to transfers of information among ourselves, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial
relations, we could be subject to significant penalties and negative publicity, which would adversely affect us. 
 We are also
subject to certain regulations in Argentina that impose VAT and sales tax collection obligations on the Company in certain provinces in connection with users sales through the platform. Other jurisdictions may issue new legislation in that
regard. If users were to reduce or stop using our website or services as a result, our business could be materially harmed. 
 We are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition laws. 
 We receive scrutiny from various government agencies under competition laws in the countries where we operate. Some
jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. Other companies and government agencies may allege that our actions violate antitrust or competition laws, or otherwise
constitute unfair competition. Contractual agreements with buyers, sellers, or other companies could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation. Also, our unilateral business practices could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust
litigation. Some regulators may perceive our business to have so much market power that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive. Such claims and investigations, even if without foundation, typically are very
expensive to defend, involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort, and could result in significant judgments against us. 
 Our business is an Internet platform for commercial transactions in which all commercial activity depends on our users and is therefore largely outside of our control. 
 Our business is dependent on Internet users listing and purchasing their items and services on our Internet platform. Therefore, we depend
on the commercial activity, including both sales and purchases that our users generate. We do not choose which items will be listed, nor do we make pricing or other decisions relating to the products and services bought and sold on our platform.
Therefore, the principal drivers of our business are largely outside of our control, and we depend on the continued preference for our platform by millions of individual users. 
 We could face liability for the sale of regulated and prohibited items, unpaid items or undelivered purchases, and the sale of defective items. 
 Laws specifying the scope of liability of providers of online services for activities of their users through their service are currently
unsettled in most of the Latin American countries where we operate. We have implemented what we believe to be clear policies that are incorporated in our terms of use that prohibit the sale of certain items on our platform and have implemented
programs to monitor and exclude unlawful goods and services. Despite these efforts, we may be unable to prevent our users from exchanging unlawful goods or services or exchanging goods in an unlawful manner, and we may be subject to allegations of
civil or criminal liability for the unlawful activities of these users. 
 More specifically, we are aware that certain goods,
such as alcohol, tobacco, firearms, animals, adult material and other goods that may be subject to regulation by local or national authorities of various jurisdictions have been traded on the MercadoLibre Marketplace. As a consequence of these
transactions, appropriate authorities may impose fines against us. We have at times been subject to fines in Brazil for certain users sale of products that have not been approved by the government. We cannot provide any assurances that we will
successfully avoid civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities that our users carry out through our platforms in the future. If we suffer potential liability for any unlawful activities of our users, we may need to implement additional
measures to reduce our exposure to this liability, which may require, among other things that we spend substantial resources and/or discontinue certain service offerings. Any costs that we incur as a result of this liability or asserted liability
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 We believe that
government and consumer protection agencies have received a substantial number of complaints about both the MercadoLibre Marketplace and MercadoPago. We believe that these complaints are small as a percentage of our total transactions, but they
could become large in aggregate numbers over time. From time to time, we are involved in disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as
our business has expanded and our Company has grown larger. We are likely to receive new inquiries from regulatory agencies in the future, which may lead to actions against us. We have responded to all inquiries from regulatory agencies and
described our services, operating procedures and requested information. If one or more of these agencies is not satisfied with our response to current or future inquiries, we could be subject to enforcement actions, fines or penalties, or forced to
change our operating practices in ways that could harm our business, or if during these inquiries any of our processes are found to violate laws on consumer protection, or to constitute unfair business practices, we could be subject to civil
damages, enforcement actions, fines or penalties. Such actions or fines could require us to restructure our business processes in ways that would harm our business and cause us to incur substantial costs. 
 In addition, our success depends largely upon sellers accurately representing and reliably delivering the listed goods and buyers paying
the agreed purchase price. We have received in the past, and anticipate that we will receive in the future, complaints from users who did not receive the purchase price or the goods agreed to be exchanged. While we can suspend the accounts of users
who fail to fulfill their delivery obligations to other users, we do not have the ability to require users to make payments or deliver goods sold. We also receive complaints from buyers regarding the quality of the goods purchased or the partial or
non-delivery of purchased items. We have tried to reduce our liability to buyers for unfulfilled transactions or other claims related to the quality of the purchased goods by offering a free Buyer Protection Program to buyers who meet certain
conditions. Although the number of claims that we have paid through this program is not currently significant, we may in the future receive additional requests from users requesting reimbursement or threatening legal action against us if we do not
reimburse them, the result of which could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. In addition, as discussed above, we may be liable in Brazil for fraud committed by sellers and losses incurred by buyers when purchase items
through our platform in Brazil. We keep expanding the coverage of our Buyers Protection Program. This coverage expansion may impact the number and amount of reimbursements we are required to make. Our users have been and will continue to be
targeted by parties using fraudulent spoof and phishing emails that appear to be legitimate emails sent by MercadoLibre or MercadoPago or by a user of one of our businesses, but direct recipients to fake websites operated by
the sender of the email or misstates that certain payment was credited in MercadoPago and request that the recipient send the product sold or send a password or other confidential information. Despite our efforts to mitigate spoof and
phishing emails, those activities could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brands or discourage use of our websites and increase our costs. 
 We have received in the past, and anticipate that we will receive in the future, legal
actions from users who received spoof emails and sent the product and did not receive the purchase price. Currently, we have a case, in which our Brazilian subsidiary was sued by a user that sent the product to the buyer but did not receive any
payment, since the email he received was a spoof and had not been sent by the Company. In 2007, a lower court judge found our Brazilian subsidiary responsible for that spoof and ordered it to pay the plaintiff the amount of approximately $1,500, to
be adjusted against inflation plus default interest, which was ratified by the Superior Court of Justice of Brazil . Our Brazilian subsidiary filed for clarification however the outcome of this matter is still pending. 
 Any litigation related to unpaid or undelivered purchases or defective items could be expensive for us, divert managements
attention and could result in increased costs of doing business. In addition, any negative publicity generated as a result of the fraudulent or deceptive conduct of our users could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brands. 
 We could face legal and financial liability for the sale of items that infringe on the intellectual property and distribution rights of
others and for information disseminated on the MercadoLibre Marketplace. 
 Even though we monitor listings on our web
sites, we are not able to detect every item that may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties. As a result, we have received in the past, and anticipate that we will receive in the future, complaints alleging that certain items
listed and/or sold through the MercadoLibre Marketplace or Mercadoshops and/or using MercadoPago infringe third-party copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights. Content owners and other intellectual property rights owners have
been active in defending their rights against online companies, including us. We have taken steps to work in coordination and cooperation with the intellectual property rights owners to seek to eliminate allegedly infringing items listed in the
MercadoLibre Marketplace. Our user policy prohibits the sale of goods which may infringe third-party intellectual property rights, and we may suspend the account of any user who infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Despite all these
measures some rights owners have expressed that our efforts are insufficient. Content owners and other intellectual property rights owners have been active in asserting their purported rights against online companies. Allegations of infringement of
intellectual property rights could result in threats of litigation and actual litigation against us by rights owners. 
 Specifically, allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights have already resulted in claims against us from time to time,
including litigation in Brazil brought (without limitation) by Cartier International B.V., Montblanc Simplo Gmbh, Richemont International S.A., Puma Sports Ltda., Lacoste do Brasil Indústria e Comercio Ltda., Sporloisirs S.A., Qix Skateboards
Indústria e Comercio Ltda, Vintage Denim Ltda., Editora COC Empreendimentos Culturais Ltda., Barros Fischer e Associados Ltda., Fallms Distribuição de Fitas Ltda., 100% Nacional Distribuidora de Fitas Ltda., Xuxa
Promoções e Produções Artísticas Limitada, Praetorium Instituto de Ensino, Pesquisas e Atividades de Extensão e Direito Ltda., Sette Informações Educacionãis Ltda., Serasa S.A., Botelho
Industria e Distribuiçāo Cinematográfica Ltda., and Citizen Watch do Brasil S/A and in Argentina brought by Nike International Ltd., Iglesia Mesianica Mundial Sekai Kyusei Kio. 
 While we have been largely successful to date in settling existing claims by agreeing to monitor the brands, the current lack of laws
related to the Internet results in great uncertainty as to the outcome of any future claims. Other companies providing similar services to us have also been subject to these types of claims in the United States and other countries. In
June 2008, the Paris Court of Commerce ruled that eBay, Inc. and eBay International AG were liable to Louis Vuitton Malletier and Christian Dior Couture for failing to prevent the sale of counterfeit items on its web sites that traded on
plaintiffs brand names and for interfering with the plaintiffs selective distribution network. The court awarded plaintiffs approximately EUR 38.6 million in damages and issued an injunction prohibiting all sales of perfumes and
cosmetics bearing the Dior, Guerlain, Givenchy and Kenzo brands over all worldwide eBay sites to the extent they are accessible from France. We cannot assure you that MercadoLibre and MercadoPago will not be subject to similar suits, which could
result in substantial monetary awards or penalties and costly injunctions against us. 
 We continue to have outstanding
litigation and, although we generally intend to defend each of these claims, we cannot assure you that we will be successful. This type of litigation is expensive for us, could result in damage awards or increased costs of doing business through
adverse judgments or settlements, could require us to change our business practices in expensive ways, or could otherwise harm our business. Litigation against other online companies could result in interpretations of the law that could also require
us to change our business practices or otherwise increase our costs. 
 In addition, new bills of laws have been introduced in
the U.S. Congress proposing certain regulation to Internet companies with respect to intellectual property issues, like the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect Intellectual Property Act (PIPA), that would give
intellectual property rights owners and the government broad powers to file lawsuits against websites accused of facilitating copyright infringement, and such lawsuits could result in, among other consequences, payment providers from doing business
with allegedly infringing sites, as well as search engines being precluded from linking to, and Internet service providers being required to block access to, such sites. If these or similar laws were finally enacted, it could have a negative impact
in our business. 
 We are subject to risks with respect to information and material disseminated through our platforms. 
 It is possible that third parties could bring claims against us for defamation, libel, invasion of privacy,
negligence, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through our platforms. Other online services companies are facing several lawsuits for this type of liability. As mentioned previously, the liability of
online services companies for content hosted and the information carried on or disseminated through their services is currently unclear in the Latin American countries where we operate. This could allow for claims being made against us by
purportedly aggrieved third parties. For example, the MercadoLibre service contains a User Feedback feature, which includes reviews and ratings from users regarding the reliability of other users in paying or delivering goods sold in a transaction
promptly. Although users generate all the feedback, it is possible that a party could bring a claim for defamation or other injury against us for content posted through the User Feedback feature. If we or other online services providers are held
liable or potentially liable for information carried on or disseminated through our platforms, we may have to implement measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. Any measures we may need to implement may involve spending substantial
resources and/or discontinuing certain services. Any costs that we incur as a result of liability or asserted liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, public
attention to liability issues, lawsuits and legislative proposals could impact the growth of Internet use, and subsequently have a negative impact on our business results. 
 The market in which we operate is rapidly evolving and we may not be able to maintain our profitability. 
 As a result of the emerging nature of the markets in which we compete, the increased variety of services offered on our web site and the rapidly evolving nature of our business, it is particularly
difficult for us to forecast our revenues or earnings accurately. In addition, we have no backlog and substantially all of our net revenues for each quarter are derived from listing fees, optional feature fees, up-front fees, final value fees,
commissions on MercadoPago payments and advertising that are earned during that quarter. Our current and future expense levels are based largely on our investment plans and estimates of future revenues and are, to a large extent, fixed. We may not
be able to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenues relative to our planned expenditures would have an immediate adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition. 
 If we continue to grow, we may not be able to appropriately manage the increased size of our
business. 
 We have experienced significant expansion in recent years and anticipate that further expansion will be
required to address potential growth in our customer base and market opportunities. This expansion has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a significant strain on management and our operational and financial resources. 
 We must constantly add new hardware, update software, enhance and improve our billing and transaction systems, and add and train new
engineering and other personnel to accommodate the increased use of our web site and the new products and features we regularly introduce. This upgrade process is expensive, and the increasing complexity and enhancement of our web site results in
higher costs. Failure to upgrade our technology, features, transaction processing systems, security infrastructure, or network infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic or transaction volume could materially harm our business. Adverse
consequences could include unanticipated system disruptions, slower response times, degradation in levels of customer support, impaired quality of users experiences of our services and delays in reporting accurate financial information. 
 Our revenues depend on prompt and accurate billing processes. Our failure to grow our transaction-processing capabilities to
accommodate the increasing number of transactions that must be billed on our web site would materially harm our business and our ability to collect revenue. 
 Furthermore, we may need to enter into relationships with various strategic partners, web sites and other online service providers and other third parties necessary to our business. The increased
complexity of managing multiple commercial relationships could lead to execution problems that can affect current and future revenues and operating margins. 
 Our current and planned systems, procedures and controls, personnel and third party relationships may not be adequate to support our future operations. Our failure to manage growth effectively could have
a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our systems may fail or suffer interruptions
due to human acts, technical problems, or natural disasters. 
 Our success, and in particular our ability to facilitate
trades or payments successfully and provide high quality customer service, depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware systems. Substantially all of our computer hardware for operating the
MercadoLibre Marketplace and MercadoPago services is currently located at the facilities of the Savvis Datacenter in Sterling, Virginia, with a redundant database backup in Atlanta, Georgia. These systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or
interruption from earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, fires, power loss, computer viruses, telecommunication failures, physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorism, and similar events. If our system suffers a
major failure, it would take as much as several days to get the service running again because our Atlanta database is only a backup with very limited hardware. 
 We also have no formal disaster recovery plan or alternative providers of hosting services and do not carry
business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. Despite any precautions we have taken or plan to take, if there is a natural disaster or major failure, a decision by our providers to close one of the facilities we use
without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problem at the Virginia or Atlanta facilities, the services we provide could suffer interruptions. We currently have no plans to upgrade the Atlanta facility capabilities. Additionally, in the
occurrence of such pronounced, frequent or persistent system failures, our reputation and name brand could be materially adversely affected. 
 We are subject to security breaches or other confidential data theft from our systems, which can adversely affect our reputation and business. 
 A significant risk associated with online commerce and communications is the secure transmission of confidential
information over public networks. Currently, a number of MercadoLibre users authorize us to bill their credit card accounts or debit their bank accounts directly, or use MercadoPago to pay for their transactions. We rely on encryption and
authentication necessary to provide the security and authentication technology to transmit confidential information securely, including customer credit card numbers and other account information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in
the field of cryptography, or other events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology that we use to protect customer transaction data. If our security were compromised, it could have a material adverse effect on our
reputation. We cannot assure you that our security measures will prevent security breaches or that failure to prevent them will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 As stated above, our users are targeted by parties using fraudulent spoof and phishing emails to misappropriate
passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal information or to introduce viruses to our users computers. Those emails appear to be legitimate emails sent by MercadoLibre or MercadoPago or by a user of one of our businesses, but direct
recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email or misstates that certain payment was credited in MercadoPago and request that the recipient send the product sold or provide a password or other confidential information. Despite our
efforts to mitigate spoof and phishing emails, those activities could damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brands or discourage use of our websites and increase our costs. 
 We depend on key personnel, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Our performance depends substantially on the continued services and on the performance of our senior management and other key personnel.
Our ability to retain and motivate these and other officers and employees is fundamental to our performance. 
 Our most senior
executive officers have been with us since 2000 or before, providing us with a stable and experienced management team. The loss of the services of any of these executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. We do not have employment agreements with any of our key technical personnel other than our senior executives (whose agreements are for an undetermined period and establish general employment
terms and conditions) and maintain no key person life insurance policies. The option grants to most of our senior management and key employees are fully vested. Therefore, these employees may not have sufficient financial incentive to
stay with us. Consequently we may have to incur costs to replace key employees who leave and our ability to execute our business model could be impaired if we cannot replace them in a timely manner. 
 Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled technical,
managerial, marketing and customer service personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully attract, integrate, train, retain, motivate and manage sufficiently qualified personnel. 
 Currently our revenues depend substantially on up-front fees, final value fees and fees related to our payment solution we charge to
sellers and such revenues may decrease if market conditions force us to lower such fees or if we fail to diversify our sources of revenue. 
 Our revenues currently depend primarily on up-front fees, final value fees and fees related to our payment solution that we charge to our sellers for listing and upon selling their items and services. Our
platform depends upon providing access to a large market at a lower cost than other comparable alternatives. If market conditions force us to substantially lower our listing or final value fees or fees related to our payment solution or if we fail
to continue to attract new buyers and sellers, and if we are unable to effectively diversify and expand our sources of revenue, our profitability, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 
 We are subject to consumer trends and could lose revenue if certain items become less popular. 
 We derive substantially all of our revenues from fees charged to sellers for listing products for sale on our service, fees from
successfully completed transactions and fees for making payments through MercadoPago. Our future revenues depend on continued demand for the types of goods that users list on the MercadoLibre Marketplace or pay with MercadoPago on or off the
MercadoLibre Marketplace. The popularity of certain categories of items, such as computer and electronic products, cellular telephones, toys, apparel and sporting goods, among consumers may vary over time due to perceived availability, subjective
value, and trends of consumers and society in general. A decline in the demand for or popularity of certain items sold through the MercadoLibre Marketplace without an increase in demand for different items could reduce the overall volume of
transactions on our platforms, resulting in reduced revenues. 
 In addition, certain consumer fads may temporarily inflate the volume of certain types of items
listed on the MercadoLibre Marketplace, placing a significant strain on our infrastructure and transaction capacity. These trends may also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from one quarter to the next. 
 Retailers may encourage manufacturers to limit distribution of their products to dealers who sell through us, or may encourage the government to
limit online commerce. 
 Manufacturers may attempt to enforce minimum resale price maintenance arrangements to prevent
distributors from selling on our websites or on the Internet generally, or at prices that would make our site attractive relative to other alternatives. The adoption by manufacturers of policies, or the adoption of new laws or regulations or
interpretations of existing laws or regulations by government authorities, in each case discouraging the sales of goods or services over the Internet, could force our users to stop selling certain products on our websites. Increased competition or
anti-Internet distribution policies or regulations may result in reduced operating margins, loss of market share and diminished value of our brand. In order to respond to changes in the competitive environment, we may, from time to time, make
pricing, service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that may be controversial with and lead to dissatisfaction among some of our sellers, which could reduce activity on our websites and harm our profitability. 
 The success of other e-commerce companies such as eBay and Amazon is not an indication of our future financial performance. 
 Several companies that operate e-commerce web sites, such as eBay and Amazon, have been successful and profitable in the past. However, we
operate in a business environment that is different from eBays, Amazons and other e-commerce companies operating outside of Latin America. These differences include the smaller size of the national markets, lower Internet adoption rates,
lower confidence in remote payment mechanisms, less reliable postal and parcel services, and less predictable political, economic regulatory and legal environments. Therefore, you should not interpret the success of any of these companies as
indicative of our financial prospects. 
 Finally, Amazon started operations in Brazil during 2012 by offering on-line content.
We do not compete in this space, however the consolidation and expansion of their operations in Brazil, could eventually lead to more direct competition. 
 We could be subject to liability and forced to change our MercadoPago business practices if we were found to be subject to or in violation of any laws or regulations governing banking, money
transmission, tax regulation, anti-money laundering regulations or electronic funds transfers in any country where we operate; or if new legislation regarding these issues were enacted in the countries where MercadoPago operates. 
 A number of jurisdictions where we operate have enacted legislation regulating money transmitters. We believe we do not require a license
under the existing statutes of Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Venezuela to operate MercadoPago with its current agency-based structure. If our operation of MercadoPago were found to be in violation of money services laws or
regulations or any tax or anti-money laundering regulations, or engaged in an unauthorized banking or financial business, we could be subject to liability, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain countries, or forced to change our
business practices or to become a financial entity. Any change to our MercadoPago business practices that makes the service less attractive to customers or prohibits its use by residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease the speed of trade
on the MercadoLibre Marketplace, which would further harm our business. Even if we are not forced to change our MercadoPago business practices, we could be required to obtain licenses or regulatory approvals that could be very expensive and time
consuming, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain these licenses in a timely manner or at all. 
 MercadoPago is
susceptible to illegal uses, and we could potentially face liability for any illegal use of MercadoPago. 
 MercadoPago,
like the MercadoLibre platform, is also susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses, including, fraudulent and illicit sales, money laundering, bank fraud, different fraud schemes and online securities fraud. In addition, MercadoPagos
service could be subject to unauthorized credit card use, identity theft, break-ins to withdraw account balances, employee fraud or other internal security breaches, and we may be required to reimburse customers for any funds stolen as a result of
such breaches. Merchants could also request reimbursement, or stop using MercadoPago, if they are affected by buyer fraud. 
 In
addition, MercadoPago may be subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations that prohibit, among other things, its involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities or impose taxes collection obligations or obligation to provide
certain information about transactions occurred in our platforms, or about our users. Because of different laws and regulations in each jurisdiction where we operate, as we roll-out and adapt MercadoPago in other countries, additional verification
and reporting requirements could apply. These regulations could impose significant costs on us and make it more difficult for new customers to join the MercadoPago network. Future regulation (under the USA Patriot Act or otherwise), may require us
to learn more about the identity of our MercadoPago customers before opening an account, to obtain additional verification of customers and to monitor our customers activities more closely. These requirements, as well as any additional
restrictions imposed by credit card associations, could raise our MercadoPago costs significantly and reduce the attractiveness of MercadoPago. Failure to comply with money laundering laws could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits,
penalties, and forfeiture of significant assets. 
 We incur losses from claims that customers did not authorize a purchase,
from buyer fraud and from erroneous transmissions. In addition to the direct costs of such losses, if they are related to credit card transactions and become excessive, they could result in MercadoPago losing the right to accept credit cards for
payment. If MercadoPago is unable to accept credit cards, our business will be adversely affected given that credit cards are the most widely used method for funding the MercadoPago accounts. We have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of
fraud on MercadoPago, such as running card security code (CSC) checks in some countries, having users call us to have them answer personal questions to confirm their identity or asking users to confirm the amount of a small debit for higher
risk transactions, implementing caps on overall spending per users and data mining to detect potentially fraudulent transactions. However, these measures may not be effective against current and new forms of fraud. If these measures do not succeed,
excessive charge-backs may arise in the future and our business will be adversely affected. 
 Our failure to manage MercadoPago customer funds properly would harm our business. 
 Our ability to manage and account accurately for MercadoPago customer funds requires a high level of internal controls. We have neither an
established operating history nor proven management experience in maintaining, over a long term, these internal controls. As MercadoPago continues to grow, we must strengthen our internal controls accordingly. MercadoPagos success requires
significant public confidence in our ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain necessary controls or to properly manage customer funds could severely reduce customer use of
MercadoPago. 
 MercadoPago is a relatively new service that faces competition from other payment method and competitors may adversely
affect the success of MercadoPago. 
 MercadoPago competes with existing online and offline payment methods, including,
among others, banks and other providers of traditional payment methods, particularly credit cards, checks, money orders, and electronic bank deposits; international online payments services such as PayPal and Google Checkout, and local online
payment services such as DineroMail in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, and Bcash, PagSeguro and MOIP in Brazil; money remitters such as Western Union; the use of cash, which is often preferred in Latin America; and offline funding
alternatives such as cash deposit and money transmission services. Some of these services may operate at lower commission rates than MercadoPagos current rates and, accordingly, we are subject to market pressures with respect to the
commissions we charge for MercadoPago services. 
 MercadoPagos competitors may respond to new or emerging technologies
and changes in customer requirements faster and more effectively than us. They may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services than we do for MercadoPago. Competing services tied to established banks and
other financial institutions may offer greater liquidity and create greater consumer confidence in the safety and efficacy of their services than MercadoPago. Established banks and other financial institutions currently offer online payments and
those which do not yet provide such a service could quickly and easily develop it, including mobile phone carriers. 
 We are
currently in the process of rolling out our direct payments product in some countries in order to provide a better experience to our users. For the same reason we are also charging a single final value fee for the right to use MercadoLibre and
MercadoPago in those transactions. This change may result in our experiencing a lower combined take rate. We consider MercadoPagos direct payments product to be in early release and have identified several opportunities to improve upon
the product. In addition, the transition to the new system may not be a smooth one. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business. 
 We continue to expand MercadoPagos services internationally. We have no experience with the online payment solution in Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, Portugal or Uruguay.
In order to introduce MercadoPago in some countries we may require a close commercial relationship with one or more local banks. These or other factors may prevent, delay or limit our introduction of MercadoPago in other countries, or reduce its
profitability. 
 We rely on banks or payment processors to fund transactions, and changes to credit card association fees, rules or
practices may adversely affect our business. 
 Because MercadoPago is not a bank, we cannot belong to or directly access
credit card associations, such as Visa and MasterCard. As a result, we must rely on banks or payment processors to process the funding of MercadoPago transactions and MercadoLibre Marketplace collections, and must pay a fee for this service. From
time to time, credit card associations may increase the interchange fees that they charge for each transaction using one of their cards. The credit card processors of MercadoPago and the MercadoLibre Marketplace have the right to pass any increases
in interchange fees on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing. These increased fees increase the operating costs of MercadoPago, reduce our profit margins from MercadoPago operations and, to a lesser degree, affect the operating
margins of the MercadoLibre Marketplace. 
 We are also required by MercadoPago and MercadoLibres processors to comply
with credit card association operating rules. The credit card associations and their member banks set and interpret the credit card rules. Some of those member banks compete with MercadoPago. Visa, MasterCard, American Express or other credit card
companies could adopt new operating rules or re-interpret existing rules that we or MercadoPagos processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow. As a result, we could lose our ability to provide MercadoPago customers the option
of using credit cards to fund their payments and MercadoLibre users the option to pay their fees using a credit card. If MercadoPago were unable to accept credit cards, our MercadoPago business would be adversely affected. 
 We could lose the right to accept credit cards or pay fines if MasterCard and/or Visa
determine that users are using MercadoPago to engage in illegal or high risk activities or if users generate a large amount of chargebacks. Accordingly, we are working to prevent high risk merchants from using MercadoPago.
Additionally, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates to fund our MercadoPago and for that reason our profitability and total payments volume could materially decline. 
 Our operating results may be impacted by an economic crisis. 
 General adverse economic conditions, including the possibility of a severe recession and a worldwide economic slowdown, would adversely impact our operating results and business. If the current weakness
in the global economy persists or worsens, or the present global economic uncertainties persist for an extended period of time, many of our users, may delay or reduce their purchases of goods on the MercadoLibre Marketplace, which would reduce our
revenues and have a material adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, future changes in trends could result in a material impact to future consolidated statements of income and cash flows. 
 The failure of the financial institutions with which we conduct business may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and
financial condition. 
 The financial services industry experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil in 2008 and 2009,
characterized by the bankruptcy, failure or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States and other governments. If the condition of the financial services industry again deteriorates or
becomes weakened for an extended period of time, the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition: 
 Disruptions to the capital markets or the banking system may materially adversely affect the value of investments or bank deposits we currently
consider safe or liquid. We may be unable to find suitable alternative investments that are safe, liquid, and provide a reasonable return. This could result in lower interest income or longer investment horizons; 
 We may be required to increase the installment and financing fees we charge to customers for purchases made in installments or cease offering
installment purchases altogether, each of which may result in a lower volume of transactions completed; 
 We may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so. Due to the
nature of our MercadoPago business, we generate high account receivable balances that we typically sell to financial institutions, and accordingly, lack of access to credit, or bank liquidations could cause us to experience severe difficulties in
paying our sellers; and 
 The failure of financial institution counterparties to honor their obligations to us under credit instruments could jeopardize our ability to rely on
and benefit from those instruments. Our ability to replace those instruments on the same or similar terms may be limited under difficult market conditions. 
 A rise in interest rates may negatively affect our MercadoPago payment volume. 
 In each of Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, we offer users the ability to pay for goods purchased using MercadoPago in installments. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, installment payments represented 48.3%, 52.5% and
54.6%, respectively, of MercadoPagos total payment volume. To facilitate the offer of the installment payment feature, we pay interest to credit card processors and issuer banks in Mexico and Argentina and we pay interest to advance credit
card coupons in Brazil. In all of these cases, if interest rates increase, we may have to raise the installment fees we charge to users which would likely have a negative effect on MercadoPagos total payment volume. 
 Changes in MercadoPagos funding mix could adversely affect MercadoPagos results. 
 MercadoPago pays significant transaction fees when senders fund payment transactions using credit cards, PagoMisCuentas and Pago
Fácil, nominal fees when customers fund payment transactions from their bank accounts in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, and no fees when customers fund payment transactions from an existing MercadoPago account balance. Senders funded
approximately 76.6%, 76.0% and 71.3% of MercadoPagos payment volume using credit cards during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively (either in a single payment or in installments), and MercadoPagos financial success will remain highly
sensitive to changes in the rate at which its senders fund payments using credit cards. Senders may prefer credit card funding rather than bank account transfers for a number of reasons, including the ability to pay in installments in Brazil, Mexico
and Argentina, the ability to dispute and reverse charges if merchandise is not delivered or is not as described, the ability to earn frequent flyer miles or other incentives offered by credit cards, the ability to defer payment, or a reluctance to
provide bank account information to us. Also, in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina senders may prefer to pay with credit card without using installments to avoid the associated financial costs resulting in lower financial revenues. 
 Changes in MercadoPago ticket mix could adversely affect MercadoPagos results. 
 The transaction fees MercadoPago pays in connection with certain means of payment such as OXXO are fixed regardless of the ticket price,
and certain costs incurred in connection with the processing of credit card transactions are also fixed. Currently, MercadoPago charges a fee calculated as a percentage of each transaction. If MercadoPago receives a larger percentage of low ticket
transactions its margin may erode or we may need to raise prices by including a fixed fee per transaction which, in turn, may affect the volume of transactions. 
 We have no business insurance coverage, which would require us to spend significant resources in the
event of a disruption of our services or other contingency. 
 Insurance companies in Latin America offer limited
business insurance products. We do not carry any business liability or disruption insurance coverage for our operations. Any business disruption, litigation, system failure or natural disaster may cause us to incur substantial costs and divert
resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. 
 We may not be able
to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. We could potentially face claims alleging that our technologies infringe the property rights of others. 
 We regard the protection of our copyrights, service marks, trademarks, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets as critical to our
future success and rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, service mark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products and services. We have entered into confidentiality and
invention assignment agreements with our employees and certain contractors, and non-disclosure agreements with our employees and certain suppliers and strategic partners in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We
cannot assure you that these contractual arrangements or the other steps that we have taken or will take in the future to protect our intellectual property will prove sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or to deter independent
third-parties from developing similar or competing technologies. 
 We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks,
logos and service marks in each country where we operate, in the United States and in certain other Latin American countries. Effective trademark, service mark, copyright, domain name and trade secret protection may not be available or granted to us
by the appropriate regulatory authority in every country in which our services are made available online. For example, since 1999, we have filed several applications to register the name MercadoLivre and our logo in Brazil. We have
been granted the trademarks Mercadolivre (name and design, without the exclusivity to the use of the words Mercado and Livre) and MercadoPago (name and design). Nonetheless, many applications
are still pending and certain applications were denied in that country under the argument that the name was descriptive of its activities. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in obtaining these trademarks or in our challenges to existing or
future applications by other parties or by the Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial (the National Institute of Industrial Property). If we are not successful, MercadoLibres ability to protect its brand in Brazil against third-party
infringers would be compromised and we could face claims by any future trademark owners. Any past or future claims relating to these issues, whether meritorious or not, could cause us to enter into costly royalty and/or licensing agreements. If any
of these claims against us are successful we may also have to modify our brand name in certain countries. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or
copyrighted material, to third parties. While we attempt to ensure that our licensees maintain the quality of the MercadoLibre brand, our licensees may take actions that could materially adversely affect the value of our proprietary rights or
reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 To
date, we have not been notified that our technology infringes on the proprietary rights of third parties, but third parties may claim infringement on our part with respect to past, current or future technologies or features of our services. We
expect that participants in our markets will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of services and competitors in the e-commerce segment grows. Any of these claims could have a material adverse effect upon our business,
results of operations and financial condition. 
 Since 2001, eBay has been subject to a lawsuit alleging infringement of
patents relating to online consignment auction technology, multiple database searching and electronic consignment systems. In September 2001, MercExchange LLC filed a complaint against eBay and their subsidiaries in the U.S. District Court for
the Eastern District of Virginia alleging infringement of three patents (relating to online consignment auction technology, multiple database searching and electronic consignment systems) and seeking a permanent injunction and damages (including
treble damages for willful infringement). Following a trial and jury verdict, in August 2003, the court entered judgment for MercExchange in the amount of approximately $30 million plus pre-judgment interest and post-judgment interest, but
refused to grant an injunction. eBay appealed the verdict and judgment in favor of MercExchange, and MercExchange filed a cross-appeal. In May 2006, following appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court,
the Supreme Court ruled that an outright denial of an injunction in a patent case is not appropriate, and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. On August 28, 2006, MercExchange renewed its motion for a permanent
injunction in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Final briefs on such motion were filed in March 2007, and in July 2007, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia denied MercExchanges motion
for permanent injunction. MercExchange subsequently entered a notice of appeal. In December 2007, the court entered judgment for MercExchange for $25 million plus prejudgment and post judgment interest. eBay subsequently entered a notice
of appeal. 
 In February 2008, eBay and all parties involved agreed to settle and dismiss all claims and appeals stemming
from the lawsuit. As a part of the settlement, eBay purchased all three patents involved in the lawsuit, and related technology and inventions, as well as a license to another search-related patent portfolio that was not asserted in the lawsuit. 
 From time to time, we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business.
The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries are increasing as our business expands and we grow larger. Any claims or regulatory actions against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in expensive litigation,
require significant amounts of management time, and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. 
 We may not be able to secure licenses for third-party technologies upon which we rely. 
 We rely on certain technologies that we license from third parties, such as Oracle Corp., SAP AG, Salesforce.com Inc.,
Microstrategy, Radware, Juniper Networks, Cisco Systems Inc, F5 Networks, and Netapp, the suppliers of key database technology, operating system and specific hardware components for our services. We cannot assure you that these third-party
technology licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. If we were not able to make use of this technology, we would need to obtain substitute technology that may be of lower quality or performance standards or at
greater cost, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we generally have been able to renew or extend the terms of contractual arrangements with these third party service providers
on acceptable terms, we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to do so in the future. 
 Problems that affect our third-party
service providers could potentially adversely affect us as well. 
 A number of parties provide beneficial services to us
or to our users. These services include the hosting of our servers, and the postal and payments infrastructures that allow users to deliver and pay for the goods and services traded amongst themselves, in addition to paying their MercadoLibre
Marketplace bills. Financial, regulatory, or other problems that might prevent these companies from providing services to us or our users could reduce the number of listings on our web sites or make completing transactions on our web sites more
difficult, which would harm our business. Any security breach at one of these companies could also affect our customers and harm our business. 
 Complaints from customers or negative publicity about our services can diminish consumer confidence and adversely affect our business. 
 Because volume and growth in adoption of new users are key factors for our profitability, customer complaints or
negative publicity about our customer service could severely diminish consumer confidence in and use of our services. Measures we sometimes take to combat risks of fraud and breaches of privacy and security can damage relations with our customers.
To maintain good customer relations, we need prompt and accurate customer service to resolve irregularities and disputes. Effective customer service requires significant personnel expense and investment in developing programs and technology
infrastructure to help customer service representatives carry out their functions. These expenses, if not managed properly, could significantly impact our profitability. Failure to manage or train our customer service representatives properly could
compromise our ability to handle customer complaints effectively. If we do not handle customer complaints effectively, our reputation may suffer and we may lose our customers confidence. 
 As part of our program to reduce fraud losses in relation to MercadoPago, we make use of MercadoPago anti-fraud models and we may
temporarily restrict the ability of customers to withdraw their funds if we identify those funds or the customers account activity as suspicious. MercadoPago has not been subject to any significant negative publicity about this. However, users
who were banned from withdrawing funds or received fake mail appearing to be sent by MercadoPago initiated legal actions against us. As a result of our efforts to police the use of our services, MercadoPago may receive negative publicity, our
ability to attract new MercadoPago customers may be damaged, and we could become subject to litigation. If any of these events happen, current and future revenues could suffer, and our database technology operating margins may decrease. In addition,
negative publicity about or experiences with MercadoPago customer support could cause MercadoLibres reputation to suffer or affect consumer confidence in the MercadoLibre brand. 
 We may not realize benefits from recent or future strategic acquisitions of businesses, technologies, services or products despite their costs in cash and dilution to our stockholders. 
 We intend to continue to acquire businesses, technologies, services or products, as we have done in the past with our
acquisitions of iBazar, Lokau, DeRemate, CMG and AutoPlaza, which we believe are strategic, if an appropriate opportunity presents itself. We may not, however, be able to identify, negotiate or finance such future acquisitions successfully or at
favorable valuations, or to effectively integrate these acquisitions with our current business. The process of integrating an acquired business, technology, service or product into our business may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and
expenditures. Moreover, future acquisitions may also generate unforeseen pressures and/or strains on our organizational culture. 
 Additionally, acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity
securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any future
acquisitions of other businesses, technologies, services or products might require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which might not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If debt financing for potential future acquisitions is
unavailable, we may determine to issue shares of our common stock or preferred stock in connection with such an acquisition and any such issuance could result in the dilution of our common stock. 
 We are subject to seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations. 
 We believe that our results of operations are somewhat seasonal in nature (as is the case with traditional retailers), with relatively
fewer listings and transactions in the first quarters of the year, and increased activity as the year-end shopping season initiates. This seasonality is the result of fewer listings after the Christmas and other holidays and summer vacation periods
in our Southern hemisphere markets. To some degree, our historical rapid growth may have overshadowed seasonal or cyclical factors that might have influenced our business to date. Seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations could become more
pronounced over time, which could materially adversely affect our quarter to quarter results of operations in the future. 
 We operate in
a highly competitive and evolving market, and therefore face potential reductions in the use of our service. 
 The
market for trading over the Internet is relatively new in Latin America, rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we expect competition to become more intense in the future. Barriers to entry are relatively low and current offline and new
competitors, including small businesses who want to create and promote their own stores or platforms, can easily launch new sites at relatively low cost using software that is commercially available. We currently or potentially compete with a number
of other companies. 
 Our direct competitors include various online sales and auction services, including MasOportunidades.com
in Argentina, and a number of other small services, including those that serve specialty markets. We also compete with business-to-consumer online e-commerce services, such as pure play Internet retailer Submarino (a website of B2W Inc), and a
growing number of bricks and mortar retailers who have launched on line offerings such as Americanas (a website of B2W Inc), Casas Bahia and Falabella, OLX, QueBarato and with shopping comparison sites located throughout Latin America such as
Buscape and Bondfaro, located throughout Latin America. In addition, we compete with online communities that specialize in classified advertisements. Although no regional competitor exists in the classified market, local players such as Webmotors,
VivaStreet and Zap have important positions in certain markets. 
 We face competition from a number of large online communities
and services that have expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating online interaction. Certain of these competitors, including Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Yahoo! currently offer a variety of business-to-consumer commerce services,
searching services and classified advertising services, and certain of these companies may introduce broader online commerce to their large user populations. Other large companies with strong brand recognition and experience in online commerce, such
as large newspaper or media companies also compete in the online listing market. Companies with experience in online commerce, such as Amazon, may also seek to compete in the online listing market in Latin America. We also compete with traditional
brick-and-mortar retailers to the extent buyers choose to purchase products in a physical establishment as opposed to on our platform. In connection with our payment solution, our direct competitors include international online payments services
such as PayPal and Google Checkout, and local online payment services such as DineroMail in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, and Bcash, PagSeguro and MOIP in Brazil; money remitters such as Western Union. Any or all of these companies could
create competitive pressures, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 In addition, if certain websites stop linking to or containing links in their properties that send us traffic across the internet in the future, our GMV could substantially decrease and we could suffer a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We no longer have a non-competition
arrangement with eBay. If eBay were to compete directly with us by launching a competing platform in Latin America, it would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and prospects. Similarly, eBay or other larger, well-established
and well-financed companies may acquire, invest in or enter into other commercial relationships with competing online commerce services. Therefore, some of our competitors and potential competitors may be able to devote greater resources to
marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to web site and systems development than us, which could adversely affect us. Paypal is already active locally in Brazil and Mexico. 
 In many cases, companies that directly or indirectly compete with us provide Internet access. These competitors include
incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies and large Internet service providers. Some of these providers may take measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of customers use of our services.
For example, they could restrict or prohibit the use of their lines for our services, filter, block or delay the packets containing the data associated with our products, charge increased fees to us or our users for use of their lines to provide our
services, or seek to charge us for our customers use of our services or receipt of our e-mails. These activities are technically feasible. Although we have not identified any providers who intend to take these actions, any interference with
our services or higher charges for access to the Internet, could cause us to lose existing users, impair our ability to attract new users, limit our potential expansion and harm our revenue and growth. 
 Risks related to doing business in Latin America 
 Political and economic conditions in Venezuela may have an adverse impact on our operations. 
 We conduct significant operations in Venezuela, offering both our MercadoLibre Marketplace and MercadoPago online payments solution, and
have 153 employees who work in the country at December 31, 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2012, our Venezuelan net revenues represented 14.6% of our consolidated net revenues. The political and economic conditions in Venezuela are
very unstable, and we cannot predict the impact of any future political and economic events on our business. We cannot predict the economic and regulatory impact of Venezuelan governments initiatives, or whether it will extend nationalization
to e-commerce or other businesses that could impact our business and results of operations. Nationalization of telecommunications, electrical or other companies could reduce our or our customers access to our web site or our services or
increase the costs of providing or accessing our services. Certain political events have also resulted in significant civil unrest in the country. Continuation or worsening of the political and economic conditions in Venezuela could materially and
adversely impact our future business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Venezuela has suffered severe
electricity shortages that prompted the Venezuelan government to declare an energy emergency. This situation could impact the operation of our automobile classifieds points of sale in Venezuela as well as our Venezuelan users ability to access
the Internet, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our business. 
 In addition, the Venezuelan government
has imposed foreign exchange and price controls on the local currency. These foreign exchange controls increase our costs to, and also limit our ability to, convert local currency into U.S. dollars and transfer funds out of Venezuela, and may have
an adverse effect on our Venezuelan customers. We cannot predict the long-term effects of exchange controls on our ability to process payments from Venezuelan customers or on the Venezuelan economy in general. 
 Venezuela had an official exchange rate which was 2.15 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2009, and a
parallel exchange rate that was 6.05 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S. dollar at December 31, 2009. On January 8, 2010, the Venezuelan government announced that the fixed official rate of 2.15 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S.
would be changed to a dual system that included a rate of 2.6 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S. dollar for food and heavy machine importers and a rate of 4.3 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S. dollar for all others. 
 In 2009, we requested U.S. dollars at the official exchange rate for the first time for dividend distributions, through a process that
included obtaining approval from the CADIVI. We cannot predict if we will obtain approval of the CADIVI to distribute dividends using the official Venezuelan exchange rate, and the future impact in our financial condition. Starting in the fourth
quarter of 2009, as a result of the changes in facts and circumstances that affected the Companys ability to convert currency for dividends remittances using the official exchange rate in Venezuela, our Venezuelan subsidiaries assets,
liabilities, income and expense accounts were translated using the parallel exchange rate. 
 Until May 13, 2010, the only
way by which U.S. dollars could be purchased outside the official currency market was using an indirect mechanism consisting in the purchase and sale of securities, including national public debt bonds (DPNs) denominated in Bolivares Fuertes and
bonds issued by the government that were denominated in U.S. dollars. This mechanism for transactions in certain securities created an indirect parallel foreign currency exchange market in Venezuela that enabled entities to obtain
foreign currency through financial brokers without going through CADIVI. Although the parallel exchange rate was higher, and accordingly less beneficial, than the official exchange rate, some entities used the parallel market to exchange
currency because, as it was already mentioned, CADIVI used not to approve in a timely manner the exchange of currency requested by such entities. Until May 13, 2010, our Venezuelan subsidiaries used this mechanism to buy US dollars and
accordingly we used the parallel average exchange rate to re-measure those foreign currency transactions. 
 However, on
May 14th, 2010, the Venezuelan government enacted reforms to its exchange regulations and closed down the parallel market by declaring that foreign-currency-denominated securities issued by Venezuelan entities were included in the definition of
foreign currency, thus making the BCV the only institution that could legally authorize the purchase or sale of foreign currency bonds, thereby excluding non-authorized brokers from the foreign exchange market. 
 Trading of foreign currencies was re-opened as a regulated market on June 9, 2010 with the BCV as the only institution through which
foreign currency-denominated transactions can be brokered. Under the SITME, entities domiciled in Venezuela can buy U.S. dollardenominated securities only through banks authorized by the BCV to import goods, services or capital inputs.
Additionally, the SITME imposed volume restrictions on an entitys trading activity, limiting such activity to a maximum equivalent of $50,000 per day, not to exceed $350,000 in a calendar month. This limitation was non-cumulative, meaning that
an entity cannot carry over unused volume from one month to the next. 
 As a consequence of this new system, commencing on
June 9, 2010, we transitioned from the parallel exchange rate to the SITME rate and started re-measuring foreign currency transactions using the SITME rate published by BCV, which was 5.27 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S. dollar as of
June 9, 2010. 
 For the period beginning on May 14, 2010 and ending on June 8, 2010 (during which there was no
open foreign currency markets) we applied U.S. GAAP guidelines, which state that if exchangeability between two currencies is temporarily lacking at the transaction date or balance sheet date, the first subsequent rate at which exchanges could
be made shall be used. 
 Accordingly, the June 9, 2010 exchange rate published by the VCB has been used to
re-measure transactions during the abovementioned period. 
 On February 8, 2013, the Government of Venezuela, through the
Foreign Exchange Agreement No. 14, has devaluated as from February 9, 2013, the official exchange rate from 4.3 to 6.3 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S. dollars. The devaluation did not have an effect on the 2012 consolidated financial
statements; however, the devaluation will require remeasurement of the Companys Venezuelan subsidiaries non-U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities as from February 9, 2013. 
 In addition, on February 8, 2013, the Government of Venezuela, through Decree No. 9381 (the Decree) has created the
Organo Superior para la Optimización del Sistema Cambiario (or the Committee), a committee that will have the authority to design, plan and execute foreign exchange policies. At the date of this consolidated financial statements,
the Committee created by the Decree, is under the process of being designated. 
 Finally, on February 9, 2013, the Central
Bank of Venezuela has eliminated the SITME. Had the devaluation occurred on December 31, 2012, and had been 6.3 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S. dollars the exchange rate at which the Company could have had access to the foreign exchange market, the
Company would have recorded a translation loss of approximately $ 5.7 million on its year-end consolidated financial statements, considering the non-U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities of the Companys Venezuelan
subsidiaries as of that date. Because of the elimination of the SITME, we cannot assure that the foreign exchange rate at which we would have access for settling transactions denominated in U.S. dollars will be 6.3 Bolivares Fuertes per U.S.
dollars. 
 In addition, due to unstable political and economic conditions in Venezuela, the official and parallel exchange
rates could continue to devalue significantly. Strong devaluations or changes in accounting rules could impact our results materially and we may have to recognize losses in the future. 
 For accounting purposes, Venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy beginning January 1, 2010 because the three-year
cumulative blended inflation rate exceeded 100%. For this reason, as from that date, we are required to account for the operations of our Venezuelan subsidiaries using the functional currency of MercadoLibre, Inc., which is the U.S. dollar, rather
than the Bolivares Fuertes as the functional currency. As a consequence, we may experience a decrease in terms of U.S. dollars of our Venezuela revenues and expenses, which would have an adverse impact on our reported results of operations in U.S.
dollars. 
 The devaluation of the Venezuelan currency, the highly inflationary status and the government price control could
have a material adverse effect on the countrys economy and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We face the risk of political and economic crises, instability, terrorism, civil strife, expropriation and other risks of doing business in
emerging markets. 
 We conduct our operations in emerging market countries in Latin America. Economic and political
developments in these countries, including future economic changes or crises (such as inflation, currency devaluation or recession), government deadlock, political instability, terrorism, civil strife, changes in laws and regulations, expropriation
or nationalization of property, and exchange controls could impact our operations or the market value of our common stock and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In the past, the performance of the economies of Latin American countries has been affected by each countrys political situation.
For example, during its crisis in 2001 and 2002, Argentina experienced social and political turmoil, including civil unrest, riots, looting, protests, strikes and street demonstrations which have resulted in significant changes in its general
economic policies and regulations. More recently, the Argentine, Venezuelan and Bolivian administrations have nationalized or announced plans to nationalize certain industries and expropriate certain companies and property, and, in Venezuela, as
described above, the administration has imposed exchange controls. 
 Although economic conditions in one country may differ
significantly from another country, we cannot assure that events in one country alone will not adversely affect the market value of, or market for, our common stock. 
 Latin American governments have exercised and continue to exercise significant influence over the economies of the countries where we operate. This involvement, as well as political and economic
conditions, could adversely affect our business. 
 Governments in Latin America frequently intervene in the economies of
their respective countries and occasionally make significant changes in policy and regulations. Governmental actions to control inflation and other policies and regulations have often involved, among other measures, price controls, currency
devaluations, capital controls and limits on imports. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected by changes in government policies or regulations, including such factors as: exchange rates and
exchange control policies; inflation rates; interest rates; tariff and inflation control policies; price control policies; import duties and restrictions; liquidity of domestic capital and lending markets; electricity rationing; tax policies,
including royalty, tax increases and retroactive tax claims; and other political, diplomatic, social and economic developments in or affecting the countries where we operate. An eventual reduction of foreign investment in any of the countries where
we operate may have a negative impact on such countrys economy, affecting interest rates and the ability of companies such as ours to access financial markets. In addition, our employees in Brazil and some of our employees in Argentina are
currently represented by a labor union and employees in other Latin American countries may eventually become unionized. We may incur increased payroll costs and reduced flexibility under labor regulations if unionization in other countries were to
occur, any of which may negatively impact our business. 
 Latin America, including Argentina, has experienced adverse economic conditions. 
 Latin American countries have historically experienced uneven periods of economic growth, as well as recession, periods of high inflation
and economic instability. Currently, as a consequence of adverse economic conditions in global markets and diminishing commodity prices, many of the economies of Latin American countries have slowed their rates of growth, and some have entered mild
recessions. The duration and severity of this slowdown is hard to predict and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, certain countries have experienced severe economic crises, which may
still have future effects. For example, in 2001 Argentina defaulted on its sovereign debt due to severe economic turmoil. In the first half of 2005, Argentina restructured part of this sovereign debt. Certain creditors did not agree to the
restructuring. Argentinas past default and its failure to restructure completely its remaining sovereign debt and fully negotiate with the holdout creditors may prevent Argentina from obtaining favorable terms or interest rates when accessing
the international capital markets. Litigation initiated by holdout creditors or other parties may result in material judgments against the Argentine government and could result in attachments of or injunctions relating to assets of Argentina that
the government intended for other uses. As a result, the government may not have the financial resources necessary to implement reforms and foster growth, which could have a material adverse effect on the countrys economy. 
 In addition, as a result of this economic instability, the Argentine peso has been subject to significant devaluation in the past and may
be subject to significant fluctuations in the future. In August 2008, Standard & Poors Inc. downgraded Argentinas foreign debt rating based upon renewed concerns regarding economic conditions and rising fears of increased
inflationary pressures. Such economic turmoil has given rise to significant uncertainties about Argentinas economic and political future. It is currently unclear whether the economic and political instability experienced over the past several
years will continue and it is possible, that despite recent economic growth, Argentina may return to a deeper recession, higher inflation and unemployment and greater social unrest. We conduct significant operations in Argentina, offering both our
MercadoLibre Marketplace and MercadoPago online payments solution in Argentina and have our corporate headquarters in that country. Argentina is our second leading revenue producing country. As a result, our business is to a very large extent
dependent upon the economic conditions prevalent in Argentina and adverse economic conditions in that country, as well as any other Latin American country in which we operate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. 
 Local currencies used in the conduct of our business are subject to depreciation, volatility and exchange
controls. 
 The currencies of many countries in Latin America, including Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Venezuela, which
together accounted for 93.6%, 93.6% and 93.5% of our net revenues for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, have experienced volatility in the past, particularly against the U.S. dollar. Currency movements, as well as higher interest rates, have
materially and adversely affected the economies of many Latin American countries, including countries which account, or are expected to account, for a significant portion of our revenues. The depreciation of local currencies creates inflationary
pressures that may have an adverse effect on us and generally restricts access to the international capital markets. For example, the devaluation of the Argentine peso has had a negative impact on the ability of Argentine businesses to honor their
foreign currency denominated debt, led to very high inflation initially, significantly reduced real wages, had a negative impact on businesses whose success is dependent on domestic market demand, and adversely affected the governments ability
to honor its foreign debt obligations. On the other hand, the appreciation of local currencies against the U.S. dollar may lead to the deterioration of public accounts and the balance of payments of the countries where we operate, and may reduce
export growth in those countries. 
 We may be subject to exchange control regulations which might restrict our ability to
convert local currencies into U.S. dollars. For example, in 2001 and 2002, Argentina imposed exchange controls and transfer restrictions substantially limiting the ability of companies to retain foreign currency or make payments abroad. During 2011
and 2012, the Argentine government has implemented certain measures that control and restrict the ability of companies and individuals to exchange Argentine Pesos for foreign currencies. Those measures include, among other things, the requirement to
obtain the prior approval from the Argentine Tax Authority of the foreign currency transaction (for example and without limitation, for the payment of non-Argentine goods and services, payment of principal and interest on non-Argentine debt and also
payment of dividends to parties outside of the country), which approval process could delay, and eventually restrict, the ability to exchange Argentine pesos for other currencies, such as U.S. dollars. Those approvals are administered by the
Argentine Central Bank through the Local Exchange Market (Mercado Unico Libre de Cambios or MULC), which is the only market where exchange transactions may be lawfully made. Further, restrictions also currently apply to the
acquisition of any foreign currency for holding as cash within Argentina. In addition, Brazilian law provides that whenever there is a serious imbalance in Brazils balance of payments or reason to foresee a serious imbalance, the Brazilian
government may impose temporary restrictions on the remittance to foreign investors of the proceeds of their investments in Brazil. Recently, Venezuela has changed its exchange control regulations in place that restrict our ability to convert local
currency into U.S. dollars, see Item 1A. Risk Factors  Risk related to doing business in Latin AmericaPolitical and economic conditions in Venezuela may have an adverse impact on our operations. 
 Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar but our revenues are generated in the currencies of each
country where we operate. Therefore, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to these foreign currencies (i.e. the foreign currencies devaluate against the U.S. dollar), the economic value of our revenues in U.S. dollar terms will decline. 
 We are subject to increased risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Because we conduct our
business outside the United States and receive almost all of our revenues in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, but report our results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The currencies of certain
countries where we operate, including most notably Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Venezuela, have historically experienced significant devaluations. The results of operations in the countries where we operate are exposed to foreign exchange rate
fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, as occurred in previous years, the translation
of these foreign-currency-denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues, operating expenses, and net income. Similarly, our net revenues, operating expenses, and net income will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens against the
foreign currencies of countries in which we operate. For the year ended December 31, 2012, 48.1% of our net revenues were denominated in Brazilian Reais, 23.7% in Argentine Pesos, 14.6% in Venezuelan Bolivares Fuertes, and 7.2% in Mexican
Pesos. The foreign currency exchange rates for the full year 2012 relative to 2011 resulted in higher net revenues of approximately $41.6 million and an increase in aggregate cost of net revenues and operating expenses of approximately
$30.1 million. The foreign currency exchange rates for the full year 2011 relative to 2010 resulted in lower net revenues of approximately $7.1 million and a decrease in aggregate cost of net revenues and operating expenses of
approximately $5.1 million. The abovementioned foreign currency exchange rate effect includes the Venezuelan translation effect discussed in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations  Critical accounting policies and estimates  Foreign Currency Translation. While we have entered in the past into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure, these are expensive, and in
addition it is very difficult to perfectly predict or completely eliminate the effects of this exposure. 
 Exchange controls implemented
by the Argentine Government on the acquisition of U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies could have material adverse impact in our operations, business, financial condition and results of operations 
 The Argentine government has implemented certain measures that control and restrict the ability of companies and individuals to exchange
Argentine Pesos for foreign currencies. Those measures include, among other things, the requirement to obtain the prior approval from the Argentine Tax Authority of the foreign currency transaction (for example and without limitation, for the
payment of non-Argentine goods and services, payment of principal and interest on non-Argentine debt and also payment of dividends to parties outside of the country), which approval process could delay, and eventually restrict, the ability to
exchange Argentine pesos for other currencies, such as U.S. dollars. Those approvals are administered by the Argentine Central Bank through the MULC, which is the only market where exchange transactions may be lawfully made. Further, restrictions
also currently apply to the acquisition of any foreign currency for holding as cash within Argentina. 
 There can be no
assurance that the Central Bank of Argentina or other government agencies will not increase such controls or restrictions or make modifications to these regulations or establish more severe restrictions on currency exchange, making payments to
foreign creditors or providers, dividend payments to foreign shareholders or require its prior authorization for such purposes. As a result of these exchange controls and restrictions could materially adversely affect the business, financial
condition and results of operations of our Argentine subsidiary and could significantly impact our ability to comply our foreign currency obligations, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our Company. 
 Inflation and certain government measures to curb inflation may have adverse effects on the economies of the countries where we operate, our
business and our operations. 
 Most Latin American countries have historically experienced high rates of inflation.
Inflation and some measures implemented to curb inflation have had significant negative effects on the economies of Latin American countries. Governmental actions taken in an effort to curb inflation, coupled with speculation about possible future
actions, have contributed to economic uncertainty over the years in most Latin American countries. The Latin American countries where we operate may experience high levels of inflation in the future that could lead to further government intervention
in the economy, including the introduction of government policies that could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if any of these countries experience high rates of inflation, particularly in Venezuela, which was determined to be
highly inflationary, and in Argentina, we may not be able to adjust the price of our services sufficiently to offset the effects of inflation on our cost structures. A return to a high inflation environment would also have negative effects on the
level of economic activity and employment and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 Developments in other markets
may affect the Latin American countries where we operate, our financial condition and results of operations. 
 The
market value of companies like us may be, to varying degrees, affected by economic and market conditions in other global markets. Although economic conditions vary from country to country, investors perceptions of the events occurring in one
country may substantially affect capital flows into and securities from issuers in other countries, including Latin American countries. Various Latin American economies have been adversely impacted by the political and economic events that occurred
in several emerging economies in recent times, including Mexico in 1994, the collapse of several Asian economies between 1997 and 1998, the economic crisis in Russia in 1998, the Brazilian devaluations in January of 1999 and in 2002, the Argentine
crisis of 2001 and the market decline after September 11, 2001. Furthermore, Latin American economies may be affected by events in developed economies which are trading partners or that impact the global economy. 
 Developments of a similar magnitude to the international markets in the future can be
expected to adversely affect the economies of Latin American countries and therefore us. 
 E-commerce transactions in Latin America may
be impeded by the lack of secure payment methods. 
 Unlike in the United States, consumers and merchants in Latin
America can be held fully liable for credit card and other losses due to third-party fraud. As secure methods of payment for e-commerce transactions have not been widely adopted in Latin America, both consumers and merchants generally have a
relatively low confidence level in the integrity of e-commerce transactions. In addition, many banks and other financial institutions have generally been reluctant to give merchants the right to process online transactions due to these concerns
about credit card fraud. Unless consumer fraud laws in Latin American countries are modified to protect e-commerce merchants and consumers, and until secure, integrated online payment processing methods are fully implemented across the region, our
ability to generate revenues from e-commerce may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our Company. 
 Risks related to our shares 
 The price of our shares of common stock may fluctuate substantially, and our stockholders investment may decline in value. 
 The trading price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors, many of
which are beyond our control, including those described above under Risks related to our business. 
 Further,
the stock markets in general, and the Nasdaq Global Market and the market for Internet-related and technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the
operating performance of these companies. We cannot assure you that trading prices and valuations will be sustained. These broad market and industry factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our
operating performance. Market fluctuations, as well as general political and economic conditions in the countries where we operate, such as recession or currency exchange rate fluctuations, may also adversely affect the market price of our common
stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities, that company is often subject to securities class-action litigation. This kind of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of
managements attention and resources, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate in connection with the declaration
and payment of quarterly or special dividends on our common stock. 
 We continue to be significantly influenced by a group of
stockholders that control a significant percentage of our common stock and the value of our common stock could be negatively affected by any significant disposition of our shares by any of these stockholders. 
 Certain stockholders own a significant percentage of our common stock. As of December 31, 2012, eBay owned approximately
8.1 million shares of our common stock (which represents 18.4% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2012). Certain members and certain entities affiliated with members of our management also hold a significant percentage of
our common stock. These stockholders retain the power to influence the outcome of important corporate decisions or matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. The interests of these stockholders may conflict with, or differ from, the interests
of other holders of our common stock. For example, these stockholders could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of our indebtedness or outstanding shares of common stock, sell revenue-generating assets or inhibit change of control
transactions that benefit other stockholders. They may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as these stockholders
continue to own a substantial number of shares of our common stock, they will significantly influence all our corporate decisions and together with other stockholders may be able to effect or inhibit changes in control of our Company. 
 Additionally, the actual sale, communication of an intention to sell or perceptions that any of the above mentioned stockholders may sell
any significant amount of our common stock could negatively impact the market value of our common stock. 
 Provisions of our certificate
of incorporation and Delaware law could inhibit others from acquiring us, prevent a change of control, and may prevent efforts by our stockholders to change our management. 
 Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may inhibit a change of control that our board of directors does not
approve or changes in the composition of our board of directors, which could result in the entrenchment of current management. 
 These provisions include: 
 advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations; 
 a staggered board of directors; 
 limitations on the ability of stockholders to remove directors other than for cause; 
 limitations on the ability of stockholders to own and/or exercise voting power over 20% of our common stock; 
 limitations on the ability of stockholders to amend, alter or repeal our by-laws; 
 the inability of stockholders to act by written consent; 
 the authority of the board of directors to adopt a stockholder rights plan; 
 the authority of the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with any terms that the board of directors determines
and additional shares of our common stock; and 
 limitations on the ability of certain stockholders to enter into certain business combinations with us, as provided under Section 203 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law. 
 These provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay, defer or prevent
a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. See Description of capital stock for more information. 
 We may require additional capital in the future, and this additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. 
 We may need to raise additional funds in order to fund more rapid expansion (organically or through strategic acquisitions), to develop
new or enhanced services or products, to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products, businesses or technologies. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage
ownership of our stockholders will be reduced, stockholders may experience additional dilution and the securities that we issue may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock. Additional financing may not be
available on terms favorable to us or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to fund our expansion, take advantage of unanticipated acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance
services or products or respond to competitive pressures. These inabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Shares eligible for future sale may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well. 
 The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market in
the future or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem
appropriate. 
 Certain stockholders or entities controlled by them or their permitted transferees beneficially own shares of
our common stock that have not been registered for resale with the SEC. The holders of these restricted shares may sell their shares in the public market from time to time without registering them, subject in the case of our affiliates, to certain
limitations on the timing, amount and method of those sales imposed by regulations promulgated by the SEC. Holders of restricted stock will also have the right to cause us to register the resale of shares of common stock beneficially owned by them. 
 In the future, we may issue securities in connection with investments and acquisitions. The amount of our common stock issued
in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock. 
 Our
stockholders may not receive dividends or dividends may not grow over time. 
 During 2012, the Company paid quarterly
dividends on shares of our common stock throughout the year. Although the Company announced its intention to pay regular quarterly dividends on shares of our common stock in the future, we have not established a minimum dividend payment level and
our ability to pay dividends in the future may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the risk factors described herein. All dividends will be declared at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, our
financial condition and other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. Our Board of Directors is under no obligation or requirement to declare a dividend. We cannot assure you that we will achieve results that will
allow us to pay a specified level of dividends, if any, or to grow our dividends over time 
 Requirements associated with being a
public company require significant Company resources and management attention. 
 In connection with our initial public
offering, we became subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and the other rules and regulations of the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Market. We are also subject to various
other regulatory requirements, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting. If we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. As a result, our stockholders
could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm the trading price of our stock. In addition, in connection with our initial public offering in August 2007, we became subject to the rules of the Nasdaq Global Market. Our
compliance with these rules and regulations has increased our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. 
 It may be difficult to enforce judgments against us in U.S. courts. 
 Although we are a Delaware corporation, our subsidiaries and most of our assets are located outside of the U.S. Furthermore, most of our
directors and officers and some experts named in this report reside outside the U.S. As a result, you may not be able to enforce judgments against us or our directors or officers in U.S. courts judgments based on the civil liability provisions of
U.S. federal securities laws. It is unclear if original actions of civil liabilities based solely upon U.S. federal securities laws are enforceable in courts outside the U.S. It is equally unclear if judgments entered by U.S. courts based on the
civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws are enforceable in courts outside the U.S. Any enforcement action in a court outside the U.S. will be subject to compliance with procedural requirements under applicable local law, including
the condition that the judgment does not violate the public policy of the applicable jurisdiction.
