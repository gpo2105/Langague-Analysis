The following is a summary list of risk factors: \n Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic \n ● the impact of the COVID-19 virus on us, the motion picture exhibition industry, and the economy in general, including our response to the COVID-19 virus related to suspension of operations at our theatres, personnel reductions and other cost-cutting measures and measures to maintain necessary liquidity and increases in expenses relating to precautionary measures at our facilities to protect the health and well-being of our customers and employees. \n Financial Risks \n ● our ability to obtain additional liquidity, which if not realized or insufficient to generate the material amounts of additional liquidity that may be required if we are able to achieve more normalized levels of attendance and operating revenues, likely would result with us seeking an in-court or out-of-court restructuring of our liabilities, and in the event of such future liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding, holders of our common stock and other securities would likely suffer a total loss of their investment; \n ● our substantial level of indebtedness and our current liquidity constraints could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to service our indebtedness, and our ability to take advantage of certain business opportunities, which could negatively impact your ability to recover your investment in the common stock ; \n ● risks relating to impairment losses, including with respect to goodwill and other intangibles, and theatre and other closure charges; \n ● limitations on the availability of capital may prevent us from deploying strategic initiatives; \n ● we are currently not paying dividends and in the future may not generate sufficient cash flows or have sufficient restricted payment capacity under our Senior Secured Credit Facility or the indentures governing our debt securities to pay dividends on our Class A common stock;
