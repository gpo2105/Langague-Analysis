Our operations and
financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including
those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our Class
A common stock. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties
described below before making an investment decision. Additional risks not
presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also
significantly impair our business operations. 
 Risks Related to Our
Business and Industry 
 If we are unable to
increase traffic to our website and mobile app, or user engagement on our
platform declines, our revenue, business and operating results may be
harmed. 
 We derive substantially all
of our revenue from the sale of advertising, primarily through impression- and
click-based advertising.
Because traffic to our platform determines the number of ads we are able to
show, affects the value of those ads to businesses and influences the content
creation that drives further traffic, slower growth rates may harm our business
and financial results. As a result, our ability to grow our business depends
on our ability to increase traffic to and user engagement on our platform. Our traffic could be adversely affected by factors
including: 
 Reliance on Internet Search Engines. 
 As discussed in greater detail below, we rely on Internet search
engines to drive traffic to our platform. However, the display, including rankings, of unpaid search results
can be affected by a number of factors, many of which are not in our direct control, and may change
frequently. For example, a search engine may change its ranking algorithms, methodologies or design
layouts. As a result, links to our website may not be prominent enough to drive traffic to our website, and
we may not be in a position to influence the results. Although Internet search engine results have allowed
us to attract a large audience with minimal organic traffic acquisition costs to date, if they fail to drive
sufficient traffic to our platform in the future, we may need to increase our marketing expenses, which
could harm our operating results. 
 Increasing Competition. 
 The market for information regarding local businesses is intensely competitive
and rapidly changing. If the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance and reliability of our products
and services do not compare favorably to those of our competitors, traffic may decline. 
 Review Concentration. 
 Our
      restaurant and shopping categories together accounted for approximately
      42% of the businesses that had been reviewed on our platform and
      approximately 58% of the cumulative reviews through December 31, 2014. If
      the high concentration of reviews in these categories generates a
      perception that our platform is primarily limited to these categories, traffic may not increase or may
decline. 
 Our Recommendation
      Software. 
 If our automated
      software does not recommend helpful content or recommends unhelpful
      content, consumers may reduce or stop their use of our platform. While we
      have designed our technology to avoid recommending content that we believe
      to be unreliable or otherwise unhelpful, we cannot guarantee that our
      efforts will be successful. 
 Content Scraping. 
 From time to time, other companies copy
      information from our platform, through website scraping, robots or other
      means, and publish or aggregate it with other information for their own
      benefit. This may make them more competitive and may decrease the likelihood
      that consumers will visit our platform to find the local businesses and information they seek. Though we strive to detect and prevent
this third-party conduct, we may not be able to detect it in a timely manner
      and, even if we could, may not be able to prevent it. In some cases,
      particularly in the case of websites operating outside of the United
      States, our available remedies may be inadequate to protect us against
      such conduct. 
 Internet Access. 
 The adoption of any laws or regulations that
      adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the Internet, including
      laws impacting Internet neutrality, could decrease the demand for our
      services. 
 Similarly, any
      actions by companies that provide Internet access that degrade, disrupt or
      increase the cost of user access to our platform could
      undermine our operations and result in the loss of
      users. 
 Macroeconomic Conditions. 
 Consumer purchases of discretionary items
      generally decline during recessions and other periods in which
      disposable income is adversely affected. As a result, adverse economic
      conditions may impact consumer spending, particularly with respect to local businesses, which in turn could adversely
      impact the number of consumers visiting our platform. 
 We also anticipate that our traffic growth rate will continue to slow over time, and potentially decrease in
certain periods, as our business matures and we achieve higher penetration rates. In particular, the number of major
geographic markets, especially within the United States, we have not yet entered is declining; further expansion in
smaller markets may not yield similar results or sustain our growth. That our traffic growth has slowed in recent
quarters even as we have expanded our international presence is a reflection of this trend. As our traffic growth rate
slows, our success will become increasingly dependent on our ability to increase levels of user engagement on our
platform. This dependence may increase as the portion of our revenue derived from performance-based
advertising increases. A number of factors may negatively affect our user engagement, including if: 
 users engage with
      other products, services or activities as an alternative to our
      platform; 
 there is a decrease
      in the perceived quality of the content contributed by our
      users; 
 we fail to introduce
      new and improved products or features, or we introduce new products or
      features that do not effectively address consumer needs or otherwise alienate consumers; 
 technical or other
      problems negatively impact the availability and reliability of our
      platform or otherwise affect the user
  experience; 
 users have difficulty
      installing, updating or otherwise accessing our platform as a result of
      actions by us or third parties that we rely on to distribute our
      products; 
 users believe that
      their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with
      respect to the frequency, relevance and prominence of the advertising we
      display; and 
 we do not maintain
      our brand image or our reputation is damaged. 
 Table of
Contents 
 We rely on Internet
search engines and application marketplaces to drive traffic to our platform,
certain providers of which offer products and services that compete directly
with our solutions. If links to our website and applications are not displayed
prominently, traffic to our platform could decline and our business would be
adversely affected. 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to attract users through unpaid Internet search results on search
engines like Google and Bing. The number of users we attract from search engines to our website (including our
mobile website) is due in large part to how and where information from and links to our website are displayed on
search engine result pages. The display, including rankings, of unpaid search results can be affected by a number of
factors, many of which are not in our direct control, and may change frequently. For example, a search engine may
change its ranking algorithms, methodologies or design layouts. As a result, links to our website may not be
prominent enough to drive traffic to our website, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to
influence the results. Beginning in the second quarter of 2014, for example, Google made changes to its algorithms
and methodologies that may be contributing to the recent slowing of our traffic growth rate and decline in traffic in
the fourth quarter of 2014. We cannot predict the long-term impact of these changes. Although traffic to our mobile
app is less reliant on search results than traffic to our website, growth in mobile device usage may not decrease our
overall reliance on search results if mobile users use our mobile website rather than our mobile app. In fact, growth
in mobile device usage may exacerbate the risks associated with how and where our website is displayed in search
results because mobile device screens are smaller than personal computer screens and therefore display fewer search
results. 
 We also rely on application marketplaces, such as Apples App Store and Googles Play, to drive downloads of
our applications. In the future, Apple, Google or other marketplace operators may make changes to their
marketplaces that make access to our products more difficult. For example, our applications may receive
unfavorable treatment compared to the promotion and placement of competing applications, such as the order in
which they appear within marketplaces. Similarly, if problems arise in our relationships with providers of
application marketplaces, our user growth could be harmed. 
 In some instances, search engine companies and application marketplaces may change their displays or rankings
in order to promote their own competing products or services or the products or services of one or more of our
competitors. For example, Google has integrated its local product offering, Google + Local, with certain of its
products, including search. The resulting promotion of Googles own competing products in its web search results
has negatively impacted the search ranking of our website. Because Google in particular is the most
significant source of traffic to our website, accounting for more than half of the visits to our website from Internet
searches during the three months ended December 31, 2014, our success depends on our ability to maintain a
prominent presence in search results for queries regarding local businesses on Google. As a result, Googles promotion of its own competing products or similar actions by Google in the future that have the effect of reducing our prominence or ranking on its search results could have a substantial negative effect on our business and results of operations. 
 Consumers are increasingly using mobile devices to access online services. If our mobile platform and mobile advertising products are not compelling, or if we are unable to operate effectively on mobile devices, our business could be adversely affected. 
 The number of people who access information about local businesses through mobile devices, including
smartphones, tablets and handheld computers, has increased dramatically over the past few years and is expected to
continue to increase. Although many consumers access our platform both on their mobile devices and through
personal computers, we have seen substantial growth in mobile usage as we have developed our mobile solutions.
We anticipate that growth in use of our mobile platform will be the driver of our growth for the foreseeable future
and that usage through personal computers may continue to decline worldwide. As a result, we must continue to
drive adoption of and user engagement on our mobile platform, and our mobile app in particular. If we are unable to
drive continued adoption of and engagement on our mobile app, our business may be harmed and we may be unable
to decrease our reliance on traffic from Google and other search engines. 
 In order to attract and retain engaged users of our mobile platform, the mobile products and services we
introduce must be compelling. However, the ways in which users engage with our platform and consume content has
changed over time, and we expect it will continue to do so as users increasingly engage via mobile. This may make
it more difficult to develop mobile products that consumers find useful or provide them with the information they
seek, and may also negatively affect our content if users do not continue to contribute high quality content on their
mobile devices. In addition, building an engaged base of mobile users may also be complicated by the frequency
with which users change or upgrade their mobile services. In the event users choose mobile devices that do not
already include or support our mobile app or do not install our mobile app when they change or upgrade their devices, our traffic and
user engagement may be harmed. 
 Table of
Contents 
 Our success is also dependent on the interoperability of our mobile products with a range of mobile
technologies, systems, networks and standards that we do not control, such as mobile operating systems like
Android and iOS. We may not be successful in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies,
systems, networks and standards or in creating, maintaining and developing relationships with key participants in the
mobile industry, some of which may be our competitors. Any changes that degrade the functionality of our mobile
products, give preferential treatment to competitive products or prevent us from delivering advertising could
adversely affect mobile usage and monetization. As new mobile devices and platforms are released, it is difficult to
predict the problems we may encounter in developing products for these alternative devices and platforms, and we
may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support and maintenance of such products. If we
experience difficulties in the future integrating our mobile app into mobile devices, or we face increased costs to
distribute our mobile app, our user growth and operating results could be harmed. 
 In addition, if our mobile advertising products prove ineffective, our advertisers may stop or reduce their
advertising with us. Although we currently deliver advertising on our mobile app and mobile website, the mobile
advertising market remains a new and evolving market; as new devices and platforms are released, users may begin
consuming content in a manner that is more difficult to monetize. Given our limited experience in monetizing our
mobile products, we may not be able to generate meaningful revenue from our mobile products despite the expected
growth in mobile usage. For example, we may be unable to attract new advertisers if our mobile advertising
products are not compelling or we fail to continue to innovate and introduce enhanced mobile solutions. Similarly,
if we incur excessive expenses in these efforts or our products are insufficiently profitable, our ability to grow
revenue would be negatively affected. However, if our mobile solutions alienate our user base our business may
also suffer. Accordingly, we must also balance these considerations against our commitment to prioritizing the
quality of user experience over short-term monetization, which we may not do effectively. 
 If our users fail to
contribute high quality content or their contributions are not valuable to other
users, our traffic and revenue could be negatively affected. 
 Our success in attracting
users depends on our ability to provide consumers with the information they
seek, which in turn depends on the quantity and quality of the content
contributed by our users. We believe that as the depth and breadth of the
content on our platform grow, our platform will become more widely known and
relevant to broader audiences, thereby attracting new consumers to our service.
 However, if we are unable to provide consumers with the information they seek, they may
stop or reduce their use of our platform, and traffic to our website and on our
mobile app will decline. If our user traffic declines, our advertisers may stop
or reduce the amount of advertising on our platform and our business could be
harmed. Our ability to provide consumers with valuable content may be harmed: 
 if our users do not
      contribute content that is helpful or reliable; 
 if our users remove
      content they previously submitted; 
 as a result of user
      concerns that they may be harassed or sued by the businesses they review,
      instances of which have occurred in the past and may occur again in the
      future; and 
 as users increasingly
      contribute content through our mobile platform, because content contributed through mobile devices tends to be shorter than desktop contributions. 
 Similarly, if our platform does not provide current information about local businesses or users do not perceive
reviews on our platform as relevant, our brand and business could be harmed. For example, we do not phase out or
remove dated reviews, and consumers may view older reviews as less relevant, helpful or reliable than more recent
reviews. 
 Table of
Contents 
 If we fail to
maintain and expand our base of advertisers, our revenue and our business will
be harmed. 
 Our ability to grow our
business depends on our ability to maintain and expand our advertiser base. To
do so, we must convince existing and prospective advertisers alike that our
advertising products offer a material benefit and can generate a competitive
return relative to other alternatives. Our ability to do so depends on factors
including: 
 Acceptance of
      Online Advertising. 
 We believe
      that the continued growth and acceptance of our online advertising
      products will depend on the perceived effectiveness and the acceptance of
      online advertising models generally, which is outside of our control. Many
      advertisers still have limited experience with online advertising and, as
      a result, may continue to devote significant portions of their advertising
      budgets to traditional, offline advertising media, such as newspapers or
      print yellow pages directories. 
 Competitiveness of
      Our Products. 
 We must deliver ads
      in an effective manner and provide accurate analytics and measurement
      solutions that demonstrate the value of our advertising products compared to those of our
      competitors. Similarly, if the pricing of our advertising products does not compare
      favorably to those of our competitors, advertisers may reduce their
      advertising with us or choose not to advertise with us at
      all. 
 Traffic
      Quality. 
 The success of our
      advertising program depends on delivering positive results to our
      advertising customers. Low-quality or invalid traffic, such as robots,
      spiders and the mechanical automation of clicking, may be detrimental to
      our relationships with advertisers and could adversely affect our
      advertising pricing and revenue. If we fail to detect and prevent click
      fraud or other invalid clicks on ads, the affected advertisers may
      experience or perceive a reduced return on their investments, which could
      lead to dissatisfaction with our products, refusals to pay, refund demands
      or withdrawal of future business. 
 Perception of Our
      Platform. 
 Our ability to compete
      effectively for advertiser budgets depends on our reputation and perceptions
      regarding our platform. For example, we may face challenges expanding our
      advertiser base in businesses outside the restaurant and shopping
      categories if businesses believe that consumers perceive the utility of
      our platform to be limited to finding businesses in these categories. The
      ratings and reviews that businesses receive from our users may also affect
      their advertising decisions. Favorable ratings and reviews, on the one
      hand, could be perceived as obviating the need to advertise. Unfavorable
      ratings and reviews, on the other, could discourage businesses from
      advertising to an audience that they perceive as hostile or cause them to
      form a negative opinion of our products and user base. 
 Macroeconomic
      Conditions. 
 Adverse macroeconomic conditions can have a negative impact on the demand for advertising, particularly with respect to online advertising products. We rely heavily on small and medium-sized businesses, which often have limited advertising budgets and may be disproportionately affected by economic downturns. In addition, such business may view online advertising as lower priority than offline advertising. 
 As is typical in our
industry, our advertisers generally do not have long-term obligations to
purchase our products. Their decisions to renew depend on the degree of
satisfaction with our products as well as a number of factors that are outside
of our control, including their ability to continue their operations and
spending levels. Small and medium-sized local businesses in particular have
historically experienced high failure rates. As a result, we may experience
attrition in our advertisers in the ordinary course of business resulting from
several factors, including losses to competitors, declining advertising budgets,
closures and bankruptcies. To grow our business, we must continually add new
advertisers to replace advertisers who choose not to renew their
advertising, or who go out of business or otherwise fail to fulfill their
advertising contracts with us, which we may not be able to do. 
 If we fail to expand
our operations effectively, including in international markets where we have
limited operating experience and may be subject to increased risks, our revenue
and business will be harmed. 
 We intend to expand our
operations into new markets, both domestically and abroad. Our expansion into
new markets places us in competitive environments with which we are unfamiliar
and involves various challenges, such as expanding our sales force and community
management personnel to reach those new markets, and encountering different and potentially lower levels of user
engagement or advertiser demand in some or all of these markets. Our current and
future expansion plans will require significant resources and management
attention, and the returns on such investments may not be achieved for several
years, or at all. 
 Table of
Contents 
 Because we have already
entered many of the largest markets in the United States and further expansion
in smaller markets may not yield similar results, our continued growth depends
on our ability to expand effectively in international markets. We have a limited
operating history in international markets, which makes it difficult to evaluate
our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.
If the markets we have targeted for international expansion do not develop as we
expect, or if we fail to address the needs of those markets, our business will
be harmed. Expanding internationally may also subject us to risks that we have
not faced before or that increase our exposure to risks that we currently face,
including risks associated with: 
 operating a rapidly growing business in an
      environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal systems,
      regulatory systems and commercial infrastructures; 
 recruiting and
      retaining qualified, multi-lingual employees, including sales
      personnel; 
 increased competition
      from local websites and guides, and potential preferences by local
      populations for local providers; 
 our ability to achieve
      prominent display of our content in unpaid search results, which may be
      more difficult in newer markets where we may have less content and more
      competitors than in more established markets; 
 providing solutions in
      different languages for different cultures, which may require that we
      modify our solutions and features to ensure that they are culturally
      relevant in different countries; 
 compliance with
      applicable foreign laws and regulations, including different privacy,
      censorship and liability standards; 
 the enforceability of
      our intellectual property rights; 
 credit risk and higher
      levels of payment fraud; 
 currency exchange rate
      fluctuations; 
 compliance with
      anti-bribery laws, including but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt
      Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act; 
 foreign exchange
      controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the
      United States; 
 political and economic
      instability in some countries; 
 double taxation of our
      international earnings and potential adverse tax consequences due to
      changes in the tax laws of the United States or foreign jurisdictions in
      which we operate; and 
 higher costs of doing
      business internationally. 
 We may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our managements attention, result in
additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results. We
may also be unable to realize the expected benefits and synergies of any acquisitions. 
 Our success will depend, in
part, on our ability to expand our product offerings and grow our business in
response to changing technologies, user and advertiser demands and competitive
pressures. In some circumstances, we may determine to do so through the
acquisition of complementary businesses or technologies rather than through
internal development. For example, in February 2015, we acquired Eat24 to obtain an online food
ordering solution. We have limited experience as a company in the complex
process of acquiring other businesses and technologies. The pursuit of potential
future acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur
expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing acquisitions, whether or not
they are consummated. 
 Table of
Contents 
 Acquisitions that are
consummated could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the
incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our results of operations or
our ability to maintain profitability. The incurrence of debt in particular
could result in increased fixed obligations or include covenants or other
restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. In
addition, any acquisitions we announce could be viewed negatively by users,
businesses or investors. We may also discover liabilities or deficiencies
associated with the companies or assets we acquire that we did not identify in
advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness
of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due
diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and
disclosures made by the companies we acquire or their representatives, as well
as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. We may also
fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction,
including tax and accounting charges. 
 In order to realize the
expected benefits and synergies of any acquisition that is consummated, we must
meet a number of significant challenges that may create unforeseen operating
difficulties and expenditures, including: 
 integrating operations, strategies, services, sites and technologies of the acquired
      company; 
 managing the combined
      business effectively; 
 retaining and
      assimilating the employees of the acquired company; 
 retaining existing
      customers and strategic partners and minimizing disruption to existing
      relationships as a result of any integration of new
personnel; 
 difficulties in the
      assimilation of corporate cultures; 
 implementing and
      retaining uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and
      information systems; and 
 addressing risks
      related to the business of the acquired company that may continue to
      impact the business following the
acquisition. 
 Any inability to integrate
services, sites and technologies, operations or personnel in an efficient and
timely manner could harm our results of operations. Transition activities are
complex and require significant time and resources, and we may not manage the
process successfully, particularly if we are managing multiple integrations
concurrently. Our ability to integrate complex acquisitions is unproven,
particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that
develop products with which we do not have prior experience. For example, Eat24
is larger and more complex than previous companies we have acquired. In addition, Eat24 operates a business that is new to us, and we do not currently have significant experience or structure in place to support this business. We plan
to invest resources to support this and any future acquisitions, which will result in ongoing
operating expenses and may divert resources and management attention from other
areas of our business. We cannot assure you that these investments will be
successful. Even if we are able to integrate the operations of any acquired
company successfully, these integrations may not result in the realization of
the full benefits of synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational
efficiencies that may be possible from the combination of the businesses, or we may not
achieve these benefits within a reasonable period of time. 
 We rely on
third-party service providers and strategic partners for many aspects of our
business, and any failure to maintain these relationships could harm our
business. 
 We rely on
relationships with various third parties to grow our business, including
strategic partners and technology and content providers. For example, we rely on
third parties for data about local businesses, mapping functionality and
administrative software solutions. We also rely on partners for various transactions
available through the Yelp Platform, including Booker for spa and salon
appointments, Locu for menu data and Hipmunk for hotel bookings, among others.
Identifying, negotiating and maintaining relationships with third parties
require significant time and resources, as does integrating their data, services
and technologies onto our platform. It is possible that these third parties may not be able to devote the
resources we expect to the relationships. We may also have competing interests
and obligations with respect to our partners in particular, which may make it
difficult to maintain, grow or maximize the benefit for each partnership. Our
focus on integrating additional partners to expand
the Yelp Platform may exacerbate this risk. 
 Table of
Contents 
 If our relationships with
our partners and providers deteriorate, we could suffer increased costs and
delays in our ability to provide consumers and advertisers with content or
similar services. We have had, and may in the future have, disagreements or
disputes with our partners about our respective contractual obligations, which
could result in legal proceedings or negatively affect our brand and reputation.
In addition, we exercise limited control over our third-party partners and vendors,
which makes us vulnerable to any errors, interruptions or delays in their
operations. If these third parties experience any service disruptions, financial
distress or other business disruption, or difficulties meeting our requirements
or standards, it could make it difficult for us to operate some aspects of our
business. Similarly, upon expiration or termination of any of our agreements with
third-party providers, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us
in a timely manner or on terms that are favorable to us, if at all, and a
transition from one partner or provider to another could subject us to
operational delays and inefficiencies. 
 We face competition
for both local business directory traffic and advertiser spending, and expect
competition to increase in the future. 
 The market for information
regarding local businesses and advertising is intensely competitive and rapidly
changing. With the emergence of new technologies and market entrants,
competition is likely to intensify in the future. We compete for consumer
traffic with traditional, offline local business guides and directories, Internet search engines, such as Google and Bing, review and social media websites and various other online service
providers. These competitors may
include regional review websites that may have strong positions in particular
countries. We also compete with these companies for the content of contributors,
and may experience decreases in both traffic and user engagement if our
competitors offer more compelling environments. 
 Although advertisers are allocating an increasing amount of their overall marketing budgets to online
advertising, such spending lags behind growth in Internet and mobile usage generally, making the market for online
advertising intensely competitive. We compete for a share of local businesses overall advertising budgets with
traditional, offline media companies and service providers, as well as Internet marketing providers. Many of these
companies have established marketing relationships with local businesses, and certain of our online competitors
have substantial proprietary advertising inventory and web traffic that may provide a significant competitive
advantage. 
 Certain competitors could
use strong or dominant positions in one or more markets to gain competitive
advantage against us in areas in which we operate, including by: integrating review
platforms or features into products they control, such as search engines, web
browsers or mobile device operating systems; making acquisitions; changing their
unpaid search result rankings to promote their products; refusing to enter into
or renew licenses on which we depend; limiting or denying our access to
advertising measurement or delivery systems; limiting our ability to target or
measure the effectiveness of ads; or making access to our platform more
difficult. This risk may be exacerbated by the trend in recent years toward
consolidation among online media companies, potentially allowing our larger
competitors to offer bundled or integrated products that feature alternatives to
our platform. 
 Our competitors may also
enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating
histories, substantially greater market share, large existing user bases and
substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. Traditional
television and print media companies, for example, have large established
audiences and more traditional and widely accepted advertising products. These
companies may use these advantages to offer products similar to ours at a lower
price, develop different products to compete with our current solutions and
respond more quickly and effectively than we do to new or changing
opportunities, technologies, standards or
client requirements. In particular, major Internet companies, such as Google,
Facebook, Yahoo! and Microsoft, may be more successful than us in developing and
marketing online advertising offerings directly to local businesses, and may
leverage their relationships based on other products or services to gain
additional share of advertising budgets. 
 Table of
Contents 
 To compete effectively, we
must continue to invest significant resources in product development to enhance
user experience and engagement, as well as sales and marketing to expand our
base of advertisers. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
compete successfully for users and advertisers against existing or new
competitors, and failure to do so could result in loss of existing users,
reduced revenue, increased marketing expenses or diminished brand strength, any
of which could harm our business. 
 Our business depends
on a strong brand, and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance our brand
would hurt our ability to retain and expand our base of users and advertisers,
as well as our ability to increase the frequency with which they use our
products. 
 We have developed a strong brand that we believe has contributed significantly to the success of our business.
Maintaining, protecting and enhancing the Yelp brand are critical to expanding our base of users and advertisers
and increasing the frequency with which they use our solutions. Our ability to do so will depend largely on our
ability to maintain consumer trust in our solutions and in the quality and integrity of the user content and other
information found on our platform, which we may not do successfully. We dedicate significant resources to these
goals, primarily through our automated recommendation software, sting operations targeting the buying and selling
of reviews, our consumer alerts program, coordination with consumer protection agencies and law enforcement, and,
in certain egregious cases, taking legal action against business we believe to be engaged in deceptive activities. We
also endeavor to remove content from our platform that violates our terms of service. 
 Despite these efforts, we
cannot guarantee that each of the 71.2 million reviews on our platform that have
been recommended and that have not been removed as of December 31, 2014 is
useful or reliable, or that consumers will trust the integrity of our content.
For example, if our recommendation software does not recommend helpful content
or recommends unhelpful content, consumers and businesses alike may stop or
reduce their use of our platform and products. Some consumers and businesses
have alternately expressed concern that our technology either recommends too
many reviews, thereby recommending some reviews that may not be legitimate, or
too few reviews, thereby not recommending some reviews that may be legitimate.
If consumers do not believe our recommended reviews to be useful and reliable,
they may seek other services to obtain the information for which they are
looking, and may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all.
This would negatively impact our ability to retain and attract users and
advertisers and the frequency with which they use our platform. 
 Consumers may also believe that the reviews, photos and other user content contributed by our Community
Managers or other employees are influenced by our advertising relationships or are otherwise biased. Although we
take steps to prevent this from occurring by, for example, identifying Community Managers as Yelp employees on
their account profile pages and explaining their role on our platform, the designation does not appear on the page for
each review contributed by the Community Manager and we may not be successful in our efforts to maintain
consumer trust. Similarly, the actions of our partners may affect our brand if users do not have a positive experience
on the Yelp Platform. If others misuse our brand or pass themselves off as being endorsed or affiliated with us, it
could harm our reputation and our business could suffer. Our website and mobile app also serve as a platform for
expression by our users, and third parties or the public at large may also attribute the political or other sentiments
expressed by users on our platform to us, which could harm our reputation.

 In addition, negative publicity about our company, including our technology, sales practices, personnel,
customer service, litigation or political activities could diminish confidence in our brand and the use of our products.
Certain media outlets have previously reported allegations that we manipulate our reviews, rankings and ratings in
favor of our advertisers and against non-advertisers. In order to demonstrate that our automated recommendation
software applies in a nondiscriminatory manner to both advertisers and non-advertisers, we allow users to access
reviews that are both recommended and not recommended by our software. We have also allowed businesses to
comment publicly on reviews so that they can provide a response. Nevertheless, our reputation and brand, the traffic
to our website and mobile app and our business may suffer if negative publicity about our company persists or if
users otherwise perceive that our content is manipulated or biased. Allegations and complaints regarding our business practices, and any resulting negative publicity, may also result in increased regulatory scrutiny of our
company. In addition to requiring management time and attention, any regulatory inquiry or investigation could
itself result in further negative publicity regardless of its merit or outcome. 
 Maintaining and enhancing
our brand may also require us to make substantial investments, and these
investments may not be successful. For example, our trademarks are an important
element of our brand. We have faced in the past, and may face in the future,
oppositions from third parties to our applications to register key trademarks in
foreign jurisdictions in which we expect to expand our presence. If we are
unsuccessful in defending against these oppositions, our trademark applications
may be denied. Whether or not our trademark applications are denied, third
parties may claim that our trademarks infringe their rights. As a result, we
could be forced to pay significant settlement costs or cease the use of these
trademarks and associated elements of our brand in certain jurisdictions. Doing
so could harm our brand recognition and adversely affect our business. If we
fail to maintain and enhance our brand successfully, or if we incur excessive
expenses in this effort, our business and financial results may be adversely
affected. 
 If we fail to manage
our growth effectively, our brand, results of operations and business could be
harmed. 
 We have experienced rapid
growth in our headcount and operations, including through our acquisitions of
other businesses, such as SeatMe in 2013 and Eat24 in February 2015, which places substantial demands on management
and our operational infrastructure. Most of our employees have been with us for
fewer than two years; to manage the expected growth of our operations, we will
need to continue to increase the productivity of our current employees and hire,
train and manage new employees. In particular, we intend to continue to make
substantial investments in our engineering, sales and marketing and community
management organizations. As a result, we must effectively integrate, develop
and motivate a large number of new employees, including employees in
international markets and from any acquired businesses, while maintaining the
beneficial aspects of our company culture. 
 To manage this growth, we
may need to improve our operational, financial and management systems and
processes, which may require significant capital expenditures and allocation of
valuable management and employee resources, as well as subject us to the risk of
over-expanding our operating infrastructure. However, if we fail to scale our
operations successfully and increase productivity, the quality of our platform
and efficiency of our operations could suffer, which could harm our brand,
results of operations and business. 
 We make the consumer
experience our highest priority. Our dedication to making decisions based
primarily on the best interests of consumers may cause us to forgo short-term
gains and advertising revenue. 
 We base many of our
decisions on the best interests of the consumers who use our platform. In the
past, we have forgone, and we may in the future forgo, certain expansion or
revenue opportunities that we do not believe are in the best interests of
consumers, even if such decisions negatively impact our results of operations in
the short term. Our approach of putting consumers first may
negatively impact our relationship with existing or prospective
advertisers. For example, unless we believe that a review violates our terms of service, such as reviews
that contain hate speech or bigotry, we will allow the review to remain on our
platform, even if the business disputes its accuracy. Certain advertisers may therefore perceive us as an impediment
to their success as a result of negative reviews and ratings. This practice
could result in a loss of advertisers, which in turn could harm our results of
operations. However, we believe that this approach has been essential to our
success in attracting users and increasing the frequency with which they use our platform. As a result, we believe this approach has served the
long-term interests of our company and our stockholders and will continue to do
so in the future.

 We rely on the
performance of highly skilled personnel, and if we are unable to attract, retain
and motivate well-qualified employees, our business could be harmed. 
 We believe our success has
depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of our employees,
including our senior management team, software engineers, marketing
professionals and advertising sales staff. The loss of any of our senior
management or key employees could materially adversely affect our ability to
execute our business plan, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements.
All of our officers and other U.S. employees are at-will employees, which means
they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their
knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to
replace. 
 Our future depends on our
continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and
skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur
significant costs to attract them before we can validate their productivity. The
significant increase in the price of our Class A common stock since we became a
public company in 2012 may make it more difficult or costly in the future to use
equity compensation to motivate, incentivize and retain our employees. If we do
not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating
existing employees, our business could be harmed. 
 Risks Related to Our
Technology 
 Our business is
dependent on the uninterrupted and proper operation of our technology and
network infrastructure. Any significant disruption in our service could damage
our reputation, result in a potential loss of users and engagement and adversely
affect our results of operations. 
 It is important to our
success that users in all geographies be able to access our platform at all
times. We have previously experienced, and may experience in the future, service
disruptions, outages and other performance problems. Such performance problems
may be due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or
software errors and capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users
accessing our platform simultaneously. Our products and services
are highly technical and complex, and may contain errors or vulnerabilities that
could result in unanticipated downtime for our platform and harm to our
reputation and business. Users may also use our products in unanticipated ways
that may cause a disruption in service for other users attempting to access our
platform. We may encounter such difficulties more frequently as we acquire
companies and incorporate their technologies into our service. It may also
become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve the availability of our
platform, especially during peak usage times, as our solutions become more
complex and our user traffic increases. 
 In some instances, we may
not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within
an acceptable period of time. If our platform is unavailable when users attempt
to access it or it does not load as quickly as they expect, users may seek other
services to obtain the information for which they are looking, and may not
return to our platform as often in the future, or at all. This would negatively
impact our ability to attract users and advertisers and increase the frequency
with which they user our platform. We expect to continue to make significant
investments to maintain and improve the availability of our platform and to
enable rapid releases of new features and products. To the extent that we do not
effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed and
continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate
actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and operating results
may be harmed. 
 Table of
Contents 
 Our systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from catastrophic occurrences such as earthquakes,
fires, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks and similar events. Our U.S. corporate
offices and one of the facilities we lease to house our computer and telecommunications equipment are located in
the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. In addition, acts of terrorism, which may be
targeted at metropolitan areas that have higher population densities than rural areas, could cause disruptions in our
or our local business advertisers businesses or the economy as a whole. We may not have sufficient protection or
recovery plans in certain circumstances, such as natural disasters affecting the San Francisco Bay Area, and our
business interruption insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Our disaster
recovery program contemplates transitioning our platform and data to a backup center in the event of a catastrophe.
Although this program is functional, if our primary data center shuts down, there will be a period of time that our
services will remain shut down while the transition to the back-up data center takes place. During this time, our
platform may be unavailable in whole or in part to our users. 
 If our security
measures are compromised, or if our platform is subject to attacks that degrade
or deny the ability of users to access our content, users may curtail or stop
use of our platform. 
 Our platform involves the storage and transmission of user and business information, some of which may be
private, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, which could result in potential
liability and litigation. Computer viruses, break-ins, malware, phishing attacks, attempts to overload servers with
denial-of-service or other attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized use of computer systems have become
more prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur periodically on
our systems in the future. We may be a particularly compelling target for such attacks as a result of our brand
recognition. User and business owner accounts and profile pages could be hacked, hijacked, altered or
otherwise claimed or controlled by unauthorized persons. For example, we enable businesses to create free online
accounts and claim the business profile pages for each of their business locations. Although we take steps to
confirm that the person setting up the account is affiliated with the business, our verification systems could fail to
confirm that such person is an authorized representative of the business, or mistakenly allow an
unauthorized person to claim the businesss profile page. In addition, we face risks associated with security
breaches affecting our third-party partners and service providers. A security breach at any such third party could be
perceived by consumers as a security breach of our systems and result in negative publicity, damage to our
reputation and expose us to other losses. 
 Although none of the
disruptions we have experienced to date have had a material effect on our
business, any future disruptions could lead to interruptions, delays or website
shutdowns, causing loss of critical data or the unauthorized disclosure or use
of personally identifiable or other confidential information. Even if we
experience no significant shutdown or no critical data is lost, obtained or
misused in connection with an attack, the occurrence of such attack or the
perception that we are vulnerable to such attacks may harm our reputation, our
ability to retain existing users and our ability to attract new users. Although
we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data
and prevent data loss and other security breaches, the techniques used to
obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems
change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and
may originate from less regulated and more remote areas around the world. As a
result, these
preventative measures may not be adequate and we cannot assure you that they
will provide absolute security. 
 Any or all of these issues
could negatively impact our ability to attract new users, deter current users
from returning to our platform, cause existing or potential advertisers to
cancel their contracts or subject us to third-party lawsuits or other
liabilities. For example, we work with third-party vendors to process credit
card payments by users and businesses, and are subject to payment card
association operating rules. If our security measures fail to protect payment
information adequately as a result of employee error, malfeasance or otherwise,
or we fail to comply with the applicable operating
rules, we could be liable to the users and businesses for their losses, as well
as the vendors under our agreements with them, and be subject to fines and
higher transaction fees. In addition, government authorities could also initiate
legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with such incidents, which
could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or
consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. 
 Some of our products
contain open source software, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary
software and solutions. 
 We use open source software
in our products and will use open source software in the future. From time to
time, we may face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding
release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed using
such software (which could include our proprietary source code), or otherwise
seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims
could result in litigation and could require us to purchase a costly license or
cease offering the implicated solutions unless and until we can re-engineer them
to avoid infringement. This re-engineering process could require significant
additional research and development resources. In addition to risks related to
license requirements, use of certain open source software can lead to greater
risks than use of third-party commercial software because open source licensors
generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software.
Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage and, if not
addressed, could have a negative effect on our business and operating results. 
 Failure to protect or
enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business and results of
operations. 
 We regard the protection of
our trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and domain names as critical to our
success. In particular, we must maintain, protect and enhance the Yelp brand.
We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in
the United States and in certain jurisdictions abroad. We strive to protect our
intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights,
as well as contractual restrictions. We typically enter into confidentiality and
invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, as well as
confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order
to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information.
However, these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to
protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation or
disclosure of our proprietary information nor deter independent development of
similar technologies by others. 
 Effective trade secret,
copyright, trademark and domain name protection is expensive to develop and
maintain, both in terms of initial and ongoing registration requirements and
expenses and the costs of defending our rights. We are seeking to protect our
intellectual property, including trademarks and domain names, in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process
that is expensive and may not be successful, but have not done so in every
location in which we operate. Litigation may become necessary to enforce our
intellectual property rights, protect our respective trade secrets or determine
the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. For example, we
may incur significant costs in enforcing our trademarks against those who
attempt to imitate our Yelp brand. Any litigation of this nature, regardless
of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of
management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our
business and operating results. 
 We may be unable to
continue to use the domain names that we use in our business, or prevent third
parties from acquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to,
or otherwise decrease the value of our brand or our trademarks or service marks. 
 We have registered domain
names for the websites that we use in our business, such as Yelp.com. If we lose
the ability to use a domain name, whether due to trademark claims, failure to
renew the applicable registration or any other cause, we may be forced to market
our products under a new domain name, which could cause us substantial harm or
cause us to incur significant expense in order to purchase rights to the domain
name in question. In addition, our competitors and others could attempt to
capitalize on our brand recognition by using domain names similar to ours.
Domain names similar to ours have been registered by others in the United States and
elsewhere. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring and using
domain names that infringe on, are similar to or otherwise decrease the value of
our brand or our trademarks or service marks. Protecting and enforcing our
rights in our domain names may require litigation, which could result in
substantial costs and diversion of managements
attention. 
 Risks Related to Our
Financial Statements and Tax Structure 
 We have a limited
operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate
our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.
We also expect our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual
basis, which increases the difficulty in predicting our future performance. 
 We have a limited operating
history in an evolving industry that may not develop as expected, if at all. As
a result, our historical operating results may not be indicative of our future
operating results, making it difficult to assess our future prospects. You
should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and
difficulties we may encounter in this rapidly evolving industry, which we may
not be able to address successfully. These risks and difficulties include our
ability to, among other things: 
 increase the number
      of users of our website and mobile app and the number of reviews and other
      content on our platform; 
 attract and retain
      new advertising clients, many of which may have limited or no online
      advertising experience; 
 forecast revenue and
      adjusted EBITDA accurately, which may be more difficult as we sell more
      performance-based advertising, as well as appropriately estimate and plan
      our expenses; 
 continue to earn and
      preserve a reputation for providing meaningful and reliable reviews of
      local businesses; 
 effectively monetize
      our mobile products as usage continues to migrate toward mobile
      devices; 
 successfully compete
      with existing and future providers of other forms of offline and online
      advertising; 
 successfully compete
      with other companies that are currently in, or may in the future enter,
      the business of providing information regarding local
      businesses; 
 expand successfully
      in existing markets, enter new markets and manage our international
      expansion; 
 successfully develop
      and deploy new features and products; 
 manage and integrate
      successfully any acquisitions of businesses, solutions or technologies,
      such as Eat24; 
 avoid interruptions
      or disruptions in our service or slower than expected load
      times; 
 develop a scalable,
      high-performance technology infrastructure that can efficiently and
      reliably handle increased usage globally, as well as the deployment of new
      features and products; 
 hire, integrate and
      retain talented sales and other personnel; 
 effectively manage
      rapid growth in our sales force, other personnel and operations;
      and 
 effectively identify, engage and manage third-party partners and service providers. 
 If the demand for information regarding local businesses does not develop as we expect, or if we fail to address
the needs of this demand, our business will be harmed. We may not be able to address successfully these risks and
difficulties or others, including those described elsewhere in these risk factors. Failure to address these risks and
difficulties adequately could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer. 
 We expect a number of factors to cause our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which
may make it difficult to predict our future performance. 
 Our operating results could vary significantly from period to period as a result of a variety of factors, , many of which may be outside of our control. This volatility
increases the difficulty in predicting our future performance and means
comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be
meaningful. In addition to the other
risk factors discussed in this section, factors that may contribute to the
volatility of our operating results include: 
 changes in our
      pricing policies and terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or as a
      result of competition; 
 cyclicality and
      seasonality, which may become more pronounced as our growth rate
      slows; 
 the effects of
      changes in search engine placement and prominence; 
 the adoption of any
      laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of
      the Internet, such as laws impacting Internet neutrality; 
 the success of our
      sales and marketing efforts; 
 costs associated with
      defending intellectual property infringement and other claims and related
      judgments or settlements; 
 interruptions in
      service and any related impact on our reputation; 
 the impact of
      fluctuations in currency exchange rates; 
 changes in advertiser budgets or the market acceptance of online advertising solutions; 
 changes in consumer
      behavior with respect to local businesses; 
 changes in our tax
      rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities; 
 the impact of
      worldwide economic conditions, including the resulting effect on consumer
      spending at local businesses and the level of advertising spending by
      local businesses; and 
 the effects of
      natural or man-made catastrophic events. 
 We have incurred
significant operating losses in the past, and we may not be able to generate
sufficient revenue to maintain profitability. Our recent growth rate will likely
not be sustainable, and a failure to maintain an adequate growth rate will
adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 Since our inception, we
have incurred significant operating losses and, as of December 31, 2014, we had
an accumulated deficit of approximately $34.0 million. Although our revenues
have grown rapidly in the last several years, increasing from $12.1 million in
2008 to $377.5 million in 2014, we expect that our revenue growth rate will
decline as a result of a variety of factors, including the maturation of our
business and the gradual decline in the number of major geographic markets,
especially within the United States, to which we have not already expanded. As a
result, you should not rely on revenue growth of any prior quarterly or annual
period as an indication of our future performance. In addition, historically,
our costs have increased each year and we expect our costs to increase in future
periods as we continue to expend substantial financial resources on: 
 sales and
      marketing; 
 domestic and
      international expansion efforts; 
 product and feature
      development; 
 our technology
      infrastructure; 
 strategic
      opportunities, including commercial relationships and acquisitions;
      and 
 general
      administration, including legal and accounting expenses related to being a
      public company. 
 These investments may not
result in increased revenue or growth in our business. Our costs may also
increase as we hire additional employees, particularly as a result of the
significant competition that we face to attract and retain technical talent. Our
expenses may grow faster than our revenue and may be greater than we anticipate
in a particular period or over time. If we are unable to maintain adequate
revenue growth and to manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant
losses in the future and may not be able to maintain profitability. 
 Because we recognize
most of the revenue from our advertising products over the term of an agreement,
a significant downturn in our business may not be immediately reflected in our
results of operations. 
 We recognize revenue from
sales of our advertising products over the terms of the applicable agreements,
which are generally three, six or 12 months. As a result, a significant portion
of the revenue we report in each quarter is generated from agreements entered
into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed
agreements in any one quarter may not significantly impact our revenue in that
quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. In addition,
we may be unable to adjust our fixed costs in response to reduced revenue.
Accordingly, the effect of significant declines in advertising sales may not be
reflected in our short-term results of operations. 
 If our goodwill or
intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant
charge to earnings. 
 We have recorded a
significant amount of goodwill related to our acquisitions to date, and a
significant portion of the purchase price of any companies we acquire in the
future may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. Under
GAAP, we review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may not be recoverable. Goodwill is
required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be
considered include declines in our stock price, market capitalization and future cash flow
projections. If our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, our stock price
declines or any other adverse change in market conditions occurs, a change to
the estimation of fair value could result. Any such change could result in an
impairment charge to our goodwill and intangible assets, particularly if such
change impacts on of our critical assumptions or estimates, and may have a
negative impact on our financial position and operating results. 
 We may require
additional capital to support business growth, and such capital might not be
available on acceptable terms, if at all. 
 We intend to continue to
invest in our business and may require or otherwise seek additional funds to
respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features and
products, enhance our existing services, improve our operating infrastructure
and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. As a result, we may need
to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise
additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt
securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any
new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges
superior to those of our Class A common stock. Any future debt financing we
secure could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising
activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more
difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business
opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain
additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to
obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we
require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and respond
to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be
harmed. 
 The intended tax
benefits of our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements depend on the
application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions and on how we operate our
business. 
 Our corporate structure and
intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we develop and use our
intellectual property and the transfer pricing of intercompany transactions, are
intended to reduce our worldwide effective tax rate. For example, our corporate
structure includes legal entities located in jurisdictions with income tax rates
lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. Our intercompany arrangements allocate
income to such entities in accordance with arms-length principles and
commensurate with functions performed, risks assumed and ownership of valuable
corporate assets. We believe that income taxed in certain foreign jurisdictions
at a lower rate relative to the U.S. statutory rate will have a beneficial
impact on our worldwide effective tax rate. 
 However, significant
judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our
provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are
many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is
uncertain. For example, our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by
earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory
rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory
rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or by changes in the
relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and
interpretations. 
 In addition, the
application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions, including the United
States, to our international business activities is subject to interpretation
and depends on our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with
our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. The taxing authorities of
jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing
developed technology or intercompany arrangements, including our transfer
pricing, or determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not
achieve the intended tax consequences, which could increase our worldwide
effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. As
we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions, the application of tax laws can
also be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax
authorities of these jurisdictions. It is not uncommon for taxing authorities in
different countries to have conflicting views, for instance, with respect to,
among other things, the manner in which the arms length standard is applied for
transfer pricing purposes, or with respect to the valuation of intellectual
property. 
 Changes in tax laws
or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position and results of
operations. 
 Tax laws are dynamic and
subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are
issued or applied. Our existing corporate structure and intercompany
arrangements have been implemented in a manner we believe is in compliance with
current prevailing tax laws. However, the tax benefits that we intend to
eventually derive could be undermined due to changing tax laws. In particular,
the current U.S. administration and key members of Congress have made public
statements indicating that tax reform is a priority, resulting in uncertainty
not only with respect to the future corporate tax rate, but also the U.S. tax
consequences of income derived from income related to intellectual property
earned overseas in low tax jurisdictions. Certain changes to U.S. tax laws,
including limitations on the ability to defer U.S. taxation on earnings outside
of the United States until those earnings are repatriated to the United States,
as well as changes to U.S. tax laws that may be enacted in the future, could
affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. In addition, many countries in
the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations
such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively
considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our
tax obligations in many countries where we do business. Due to the expanding
scale of our international business activities, any changes in the taxation of
such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our
financial position and results of operations. 
 We rely on data from
third parties to calculate certain of our key metrics. Real or perceived
inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our
business. 
 Certain of our key metrics  the number of our unique visitors and mobile unique visitors  are calculated relying
on data from third parties. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable calculations for the
applicable periods of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage across our large user base
around the world. For example, because these metrics are based on users with unique cookies, an individual who
accesses our website from multiple devices with different cookies may be counted as multiple unique visitors, and
multiple individuals who access our website from a shared device with a single cookie may be counted as a single
unique visitor. As a result, the calculations of our unique visitors and mobile unique visitors may not accurately
reflect the number of people actually using our platform. In addition, our measures of traffic and other key metrics
may differ from estimates published by third parties (other than those whose data we use to calculate our key
metrics) or from similar metrics of our competitors. We are continually seeking to improve our ability to measure
these key metrics, and regularly review our processes to assess potential improvements to their accuracy. If our
users, advertisers, partners and stockholders do not perceive our metrics to be accurate representations, or if we
discover material inaccuracies in our metrics, our reputation may be harmed. 
 Risks Related to
Regulatory Compliance and Legal Matters 
 We are, and may be in
the future, subject to disputes and assertions by third parties that we violate
their rights. These disputes may be costly to defend and could harm our business
and operating results. 
 We currently face, and we
expect to face from time to time in the future, allegations that we have
violated the rights of third parties, including patent, trademark, copyright and
other intellectual property rights, and the rights of current and former
employees, users and business owners. For example, various businesses have sued
us alleging that we manipulate Yelp reviews in order to coerce them and other
businesses to pay for Yelp advertising. The nature of our business also exposes
us to claims relating to the information that we publish on our platform,
including claims for defamation, libel, negligence and copyright or trademark
infringement, among others. Businesses have in the past claimed, and may in the
future claim, that we are responsible for the defamatory reviews posted by our
users. We expect claims like these to continue, and potentially increase in
proportion to the amount of content on our platform. In some instances, we may
elect or be compelled to remove the content that is the subject
of such claims, or may be forced to pay substantial
damages if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to defend against these claims. If
we elect or are compelled to remove content from our platform, our products and services may become
less useful to consumers and our traffic may decline, which would have a
negative impact on our business. 
 We are also regularly
exposed to claims based on allegations of infringement or other violations of
intellectual property rights. Companies in the Internet, technology and media
industries own large numbers of patent and other intellectual property rights,
and frequently enter into litigation. Various non-practicing entities that own
patents and other intellectual property rights also often aggressively attempt
to assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies. From
time to time, we receive notice letters from patent holders alleging that
certain of our products and services infringe their patent rights, and we are
presently involved in numerous patent lawsuits. Each of our ongoing patent
lawsuits involves plaintiffs targeting multiple defendants in the same or
similar suits. We do not own any patents, and may be unable to deter
competitors or others from pursuing intellectual property infringement claims
against us. 
 We expect other claims to
be made against us in the future, and as we face increasing competition and gain
an increasingly high profile, we expect the number of claims against us to
accelerate. The results of litigation and claims to which we may be subject
cannot be predicted with any certainty. Even if the claims are without merit,
the costs associated with defending against them may be substantial in terms of
time, money and management distraction. In particular, patent and other
intellectual property litigation may be protracted and expensive, and the
results may require us to stop offering certain features, purchase licenses or
modify our products and features while we develop non-infringing substitutes, or
otherwise involve significant settlement costs. The development of alternative
non-infringing technology or practices could require significant effort and
expense or may not be feasible. Even if claims do not result in litigation or
are resolved in our favor without significant cash settlements, such matters,
and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could harm our business,
results of operations and reputation. 
 Our business is
subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign regulations and other legal
obligations related to privacy, data protection and other matters. Our actual or
perceived failure to comply with such regulations and obligations could harm our
business. 
 We are subject to a variety
of laws in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our
business, including laws regarding privacy, data retention, distribution of
user-generated content and consumer protection, among others. For example,
because we receive, store and process personal information and other user data,
including credit card information, we are subject to numerous federal, state and
local laws around the world regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use,
processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other user
data. We are also subject to a variety of laws, regulations and guidelines that
regulate the way we distinguish paid search results and other types of
advertising from unpaid search results. 
 The application and
interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly
in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. For example, we rely on laws limiting the
liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and
other third parties. These laws are currently being tested by a number of
claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair
competition, copyright and trademark infringement and other theories based on
the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted or the content
provided by users. It is difficult to predict how existing laws will be applied
to our business, and if our business grows and evolves and our solutions are
used in a greater number of countries, we will also become subject to laws and
regulations in additional jurisdictions, which may be inconsistent with the laws of the
jurisdictions to which we are currently subject. For example, the risk related to
liability for third-party actions may be greater in certain jurisdictions
outside the United States where our protection from such liability may be
unclear. 
 It is also possible that
the interpretation and application of various laws and regulations may conflict
with other rules or our practices, such as industry standards to which we
adhere, our privacy policies and our privacy-related obligations to third
parties (including, in certain instances, voluntary third-party certification
bodies such as TRUSTe). Similarly, our business could be adversely affected if
new legislation or regulations are adopted that require us to change our current
practices or the design of our platform, products or features. For example,
regulatory frameworks for privacy issues are currently in flux worldwide, and
are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future due to increased public
scrutiny of the practices of companies offering online services with respect to
personal information of their users. The U.S. government, including the White
House, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Commerce and many state
governments are reviewing the need for greater regulation of the collection,
processing, storage and use of information about consumer behavior on the
Internet, including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising
practices. The European Commission is also in the process of promulgating a new
general data protection regulation, which may result in significantly greater
compliance burdens for companies such as us with users and operations in Europe.
Changes like these could increase our administrative costs and make it more
difficult for consumers to use our platform, resulting in less traffic and
revenue. Such changes could also make it more difficult for us to provide
effective advertising tools to businesses on our platform, resulting in fewer
advertisers and less revenue. 
 We believe that our
policies and practices comply with applicable laws and regulations. However, if
our belief proves incorrect, if these guidelines, laws or regulations or their
interpretations change or new legislation or regulations are enacted, or if the
third parties with whom we share user information fail to comply with such
guidelines, laws, regulations or their contractual obligations to us, we may be
forced to implement new measures to reduce our legal exposure. This may require
us to expend substantial resources, delay development of new products or
discontinue certain products or features, which would negatively impact our
business. For example, if we fail to comply with our privacy-related obligations
to users or third parties, or any compromise of security that results in the
unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other
user data, we may be compelled to provide additional disclosures to our users,
obtain additional consents from our users before collecting or using their
information or implement new safeguards to help our users manage our use of
their information, among other changes. We may also face litigation,
governmental enforcement actions or negative publicity, which could cause our
users and advertisers to lose trust in us and have an adverse effect on our
business. For example, from time to time we receive inquiries from government
agencies regarding our business practices. Although the internal resources
expended and expenses incurred in connection with such inquiries and their
resolutions have not been material to date, any resulting negative publicity
could adversely affect our reputation and brand. Responding to and resolving any
future litigation, investigations, settlements or other regulatory actions may
require significant time and resources, and could diminish confidence in and the
use of our products. 
 Domestic and foreign
laws may be interpreted and enforced in ways that impose new obligations on us
with respect to Yelp Deals, which may harm our business and results of
operations. 
 Our Yelp Deals products may
be deemed gift certificates, store gift cards, general-use prepaid cards or
other vouchers, or gift cards, subject to, among other laws, the federal
Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the
Credit CARD Act) and similar state and foreign laws. Many of these laws
include specific disclosure requirements and prohibitions or limitations on the
use of expiration dates and the imposition of certain fees. Various companies
that provide deal products similar to ours have been subject to allegations that
their deal products are subject to and violate the Credit CARD Act and various
state laws governing gift cards. Lawsuits have also been filed in other
locations in which we sell or plan to sell our Yelp Deals, such as the Canadian
province of Ontario, alleging similar violations of provincial legislation
governing gift cards. 
 The application of various
other laws and regulations to our products, and particularly our Yelp Deals and
Gift Certificates, is uncertain. These include laws and regulations pertaining
to unclaimed and abandoned property, partial redemption, refunds,
revenue-sharing restrictions on certain trade groups and professions, sales and
other local taxes and the sale of alcoholic beverages. In addition, we may
become, or be determined to be, subject to federal, state or foreign laws
regulating money transmitters or aimed at preventing money laundering or
terrorist financing, including the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and
other similar future laws or regulations. 
 If we become subject to
claims or are required to alter our business practices as a result of current or
future laws and regulations, our revenue could decrease, our costs could
increase and our business could otherwise be harmed. In addition, the costs and
expenses associated with defending any actions related to such additional laws
and regulations and any payments of related penalties, fines, judgments or
settlements could harm our business. 
 The requirements of
being a public company may strain our resources, divert managements attention
and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members. 
 As a public company, we are
subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange
and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these
rules and regulations has increased, and will likely continue to increase, our
legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult,
time-consuming or costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems
and resources. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to
corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public
companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some
activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are
subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of
specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over
time. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters,
higher administrative expenses and a diversion of managements time and
attention. Further, if our compliance efforts differ from the activities
intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to
practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and
our business may be harmed. Being a public company that is subject to these
rules and regulations also makes it more expensive for us to obtain and retain
director and officer liability insurance, and we may in the future be required
to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain or
retain adequate coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us
to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors and qualified
executive officers. 
 Risks Related to
Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock 
 The dual class
structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control
with those stockholders who held our stock prior to our initial public offering,
including our founders, directors, executive officers and employees and their
affiliates, and limiting our other stockholders ability to influence corporate
matters. 
 Our Class B common stock
has 10 votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As a
result, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively will continue to
control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock even when
the shares of Class B common stock represent a small minority of all outstanding
shares of our capital stock. The current holders of our Class B common
stock collectively are able to control all matters submitted to
our stockholders for approval even though their stock holdings represent less
than 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2014,
stockholders who held shares of Class B common stock, including our founders,
directors, executive officers, employees and their affiliates, together
beneficially owned shares representing approximately 61% of the voting power of
our outstanding capital stock. Future transfers by holders of Class B common
stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock,
which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power
of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares, which may include existing founders, officers, directors and their
affiliates. This concentrated control will limit our other stockholders ability
to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future and, as a result, the
market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected. 
 Our share price has
been and will likely continue to be volatile. 
 The trading price of our
Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile
and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some
of which are beyond our control. During 2014, our Class A common stocks daily closing price ranged from $50.04 to $98.04. In addition the factors
discussed in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this Annual Report,
factors that may cause volatility in our
share price include: 
 actual or anticipated
      fluctuations in our financial condition and operating
    results; 
 changes in projected
      operating and financial results; 
 actual or anticipated
      changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors; 
 announcements of
      technological innovations or new offerings by us or our
      competitors; 
 announcements by us
      or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships,
      joint ventures or capital-raising activities or
  commitments; 
 additions or
      departures of key personnel; 
 actions of securities
      analysts who cover our company, such as publishing research or forecasts
      about our business (and our performance against such forecasts), changing
      in the rating of our Class A common stock or ceasing coverage of our
      company; 
 investor sentiment
      with respect to our competitors, business partners and industry in
      general; 
 reporting on our
      business by the financial media, including television, radio and press
      reports and blogs; 
 fluctuations in the
      value of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to
      us; 
 changes in the way we
      measure our key metrics; 
 sales of our Class A
      or Class B common stock; 
 changes in laws or
      regulations applicable to our solutions; 
 share price and
      volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of
      our shares; and 
 general economic and
      market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or
      international currency fluctuations. 
 Furthermore, the stock
markets have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that
have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of
many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate
to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, companies that
have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject
to securities class action litigation. For example, in August 2014, we and
certain of our officers were sued in two similar putative class action lawsuits
alleging violations of the federal securities laws for allegedly making
materially false and misleading statements. We may be the target of additional
litigation of this type in the future as well. Securities litigation against us
could result in substantial costs and divert our managements time and attention
from other business concerns, which could harm our business. 
 We do not intend to
pay dividends for the foreseeable future, and as a result, our stockholders
ability to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in
the price of our Class A common stock. 
 We have never declared or
paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash
dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of
our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general
corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at
the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on
sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never
occur, as the only way to realize future gains on their investments. 
 Anti-takeover
provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an
acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace
or remove our current management and limit the market price of our Class A
common stock. 
 Provisions in our
certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or
preventing a change in control or changes in our management. Our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include
provisions that: 
 authorize our board
      of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to
      10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock; 
 require that any
      action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual
      or special meeting and not by written consent; 
 specify that special
      meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors,
      the Chair of our board of directors or our Chief Executive
      Officer; 
 establish an advance
      notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual
      meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our
      board of directors; 
 establish that our
      board of directors is divided into three classes, with directors in each
      class serving three-year staggered terms; 
 prohibit cumulative
      voting in the election of directors; 
 provide that
      vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of
      directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; 
 require the approval
      of our board of directors or the holders of a supermajority of our
      outstanding shares of capital stock to amend our bylaws and certain
      provisions of our certificate of incorporation; and 
 reflect two classes
      of common stock, as discussed above. 
 These provisions may
frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our
current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace
members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointment the
members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware,
we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging
in any of a broad range of business combinations with 
 any “interested” stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder. 
 Future sales of our
Class A common stock in the public market could cause our share price to
decline. 
 Sales of a substantial
number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, particularly
sales by our directors, officers, employees and significant stockholders, or the
perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our
Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the
sale of additional equity securities. As of December 31, 2014, we had 63,062,071
shares of Class A common stock and 9,858,511 shares of Class B common stock
outstanding. Although a public market exists for our Class A common stock only,
shares of our Class B common stock are generally convertible into an equivalent
number of shares of Class A common stock at the option of the holder or upon
transfer (subject to certain exceptions).
