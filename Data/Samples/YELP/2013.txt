Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and
uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading
price of our Class A common stock. You should carefully consider the risks and
uncertainties described below before making an investment decision. Additional
risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may
also significantly impair our business operations. 
 Risks Related to Our Business and
Industry 
 We have a limited operating
history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future
prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful. 
 We have a limited operating history in an evolving industry that may not
develop as expected, if at all. This limited operating history makes it
difficult to assess our future prospects. You should consider our business and
prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we may encounter in this
rapidly evolving industry. These risks and difficulties include our ability to,
among other things: 
 increase the number
  of users of our website and mobile app and the number of reviews and other
  content on our platform; 
 increase the revenue from advertisers on our
  website and mobile app; 
 continue to earn and preserve a reputation for
  providing meaningful and reliable reviews of local
businesses; 
 effectively monetize our mobile products as usage
  continues to migrate toward mobile devices; 
 manage, measure and demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our advertising solutions and attract and retain new advertising clients,
  many of which may only have limited or no online advertising
  experience; 
 successfully compete with existing and future
  providers of other forms of offline and online advertising; 
 successfully
  compete with other companies that are currently in, or may in the future
  enter, the business of providing information regarding local
  businesses; 
 successfully expand our business in new and
  existing markets, both domestic and international; 
 successfully develop and deploy new features and
  products; 
 effectively integrate businesses we may acquire,
  such as Qype and SeatMe; 
 avoid interruptions or disruptions in our service
  or slower than expected load times; 
 develop a scalable, high-performance technology
  infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably handle increased usage
  globally, as well as the deployment of new features and
  products; 
 hire, integrate and retain talented sales and
  other personnel; 
 effectively manage rapid growth in our sales
  force, personnel and operations; and 
 effectively partner with other companies. 
 If the demand
for information regarding local businesses does not develop as we expect, or if
we fail to address the needs of this demand, our business will be harmed. We may
not be able to address successfully these risks and difficulties or others,
including those described elsewhere in these risk factors. Failure to address
these risks and difficulties adequately could harm our business and cause our
operating results to suffer. 
 We have incurred
significant operating losses in the past, and we may not be able to generate
sufficient revenue to achieve or maintain profitability, particularly given our
significant ongoing sales and marketing expenses. Our recent growth rate will
likely not be sustainable, and a failure to maintain an adequate growth rate
will adversely affect our results of operations and business. 
 Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses, and,
as of December 31, 2013, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $70.5
million. Although our revenues have grown rapidly in the last several years,
increasing from $12.1 million in 2008 to $233.0 million in 2013, we expect that
our revenue growth rate will decline in the future as a result of a variety of
factors, including the maturation of our business and the gradual decline in the
number of major geographic markets, especially within the United States, to
which we have not already expanded, and you should not rely on the revenue
growth of any prior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future
performance. In addition, historically, our costs have increased each year and
we expect our costs to increase in future periods as we continue to expend
substantial financial resources on: 
 sales and
  marketing; 
 domestic and international expansion
  efforts; 
 product and feature development; 
 our technology infrastructure; 
 strategic opportunities, including commercial
  relationships and acquisitions; and 
 general administration, including legal and
  accounting expenses related to being a public company. 
 These investments may not result in
increased revenue or growth in our business. Our costs may also increase as we
hire additional employees, particularly as a result of the significant
competition that we face to attract and retain technical talent. Our expenses
may grow faster than our revenue and may be greater than we anticipate in a
particular period or over time. If we are unable to maintain adequate revenue
growth and to manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant losses
in the future and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability. 
 We rely on traffic to our website
from search engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo!, some of which offer products
and services that compete directly with our solutions. If information from and
links to our website are not displayed as prominently on search engine result
pages as those from competing products and services, traffic to our website
could decline and our business would be adversely affected. 
 Our success
depends in part on our ability to attract users through unpaid Internet search
results on search engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo!. The number of users we
attract from search engines to our website (including our mobile website) is due
in large part to how and where information from and links to our website are
displayed on search engine result pages. The display, including rankings, of
unpaid search results can be affected by a number of factors, many of which are
not in our direct control, and they may change frequently. For example, a search
engine may change its ranking algorithms, methodologies or design layouts. As a
result, links to our website may not be prominent enough to drive traffic to our
website, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to influence the
results. In some instances, search engine companies may change their displays or
rankings in order to promote their own competing products or services or the
products or services of one or more of our competitors. Although traffic to our
mobile app is less reliant on search results than traffic to our website, growth
in mobile device usage may not decrease our overall reliance on search results
if mobile users use our mobile website at the expense of our mobile app. In
fact, growth in mobile device usage may exacerbate the risks associated with how
and where our website is displayed in search results because mobile device
screens are smaller than desktop computer screens and therefore display fewer
search results. Our website has experienced fluctuations in search result
rankings in the past, and we anticipate fluctuations in the future. Any
reduction in the number of users directed to our website could adversely impact
our business and results of operations. 
 Google in particular is the most significant source of traffic to our
website, accounting for more than half of the visits to our website from
Internet searches during the three months and year ended December 31, 2013. Our
success depends on our ability to maintain a prominent presence in search
results for queries regarding local businesses on Google. Google has removed
links to our website from portions of its web search product and has promoted
its own competing products, including Googles local products, in its search
results. Given the large volume of traffic to our website and the importance of
the placement and display of results of a users search, similar actions in the
future could have a substantial negative effect on our business and results of
operations. 
 If we fail to generate and
maintain sufficient high quality content from our users, we will be unable to
provide consumers with the information they are looking for, which could
negatively impact our traffic and revenue. 
 Our success depends on our ability to provide consumers with the
information they seek, which in turn depends on the quantity and quality of the
content provided by our users. For example, we may be unable to provide
consumers with the information they seek if our users do not contribute content
that is helpful and reliable, or if they remove content they previously
submitted. For example, our ability to provide high quality content may be
harmed as consumers increasingly contribute content through our mobile website
and mobile app because desktop contributions tend to be longer than content
contributed through mobile devices. Similarly, we may be unable to provide
consumers with the information they seek if our users are unwilling to
contribute content because of concerns that they may be harassed or sued by the
businesses they review, instances of which have occurred in the past and may
occur again in the future. In addition, we may not be able to provide users the
information they seek if the information on our platform is not up-to-date. We
do not phase out or remove dated reviews, and consumers may view older reviews
as less relevant, helpful or reliable. If our platform does not provide current
information about local businesses or users perceive reviews on our platform as
less relevant, our brand and our business could be harmed. 
 If we are unable to provide consumers with the information they seek, or
if they can find equivalent content on other services, they may stop or reduce
their use of our platform, and traffic to our website and on our mobile app will
decline. If our user traffic declines, our advertisers may stop or reduce the
amount of advertising on our platform and our business could be
harmed. 
 Our business may be harmed if
users view our platform as primarily limited to reviews of restaurants and
shopping experiences. 
 Our user traffic could be adversely affected if consumers perceive the
utility of our platform to be limited to finding businesses in the restaurant
and shopping categories, which together accounted for approximately 43% of the
businesses that have been reviewed on our platform and approximately 59% of our
cumulative reviews through December 31, 2013. We believe that this concentration
of reviews is primarily due to the frequency with which individuals visit
specific businesses or engage in certain activities versus others. For example,
an individual may eat at a restaurant three times in one week or go shopping
once a week, but the same individual is unlikely to visit a mechanic, get a
haircut or use a home or local service with the same frequency. However, if the
high concentration of reviews in the restaurant and shopping categories
generates a perception that our platform is primarily limited to these
categories, traffic may decline and advertising customers may be less likely to
perceive value from using our services, which could harm our
business. 
 If our automated software does
not recommend helpful content or recommends unhelpful content, consumers and
businesses alike may stop or reduce their use of our platform and products, and
our business could suffer. 
 While we have
designed our technology to avoid recommending content that we believe may be
offensive, biased, unreliable or otherwise unhelpful, we cannot guarantee that
our efforts will be effective or adequate. In addition, some consumers and
businesses have alternately expressed concern that our technology either
recommends too many reviews, thereby recommending some reviews that may not be
legitimate, or too few reviews, thereby not recommending some reviews that may
be legitimate. This may cause consumers and businesses to stop or reduce their
use of our platform or our advertising solutions. If the performance of our
automated recommendation software proves inadequate or ineffective, our
reputation and brand may be harmed, users may stop using our products and our
business and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 Our business depends on a strong
brand, and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance our brand would hurt our
ability to retain and expand our base of users and advertisers, as well as our ability to
increase the frequency with which they use our solutions. 
 We have developed a strong brand that we believe has contributed
significantly to the success of our business. Maintaining, protecting and
enhancing the Yelp brand is critical to expanding our base of users and
advertisers and increasing the frequency with which they use our solutions. Our
ability to do so will depend largely on our ability to maintain consumer trust
in our solutions and in the quality and integrity of the user content and other
information found on our website and mobile app, which we may not do
successfully. If we do not successfully maintain a strong brand, our business
could be harmed. 
 For example, if consumers do not perceive the user content on our platform to be authentic, they may lose trust
in the integrity of the content and our brand may be harmed. This may occur if consumers believe that the reviews,
photos and other content contributed by our Community Managers or other employees are influenced by our
advertising relationships or are otherwise biased. Although we take steps to prevent this from occurring by, for
example, displaying an “ambassador” badge on the account profile pages for each of our Community Managers
identifying them as Yelp employees and explaining their role on our platform, the designation does not appear on
the page for each review contributed by the Community Manager and we may not be successful in our efforts to
maintain consumer trust. Similarly, certain media outlets have previously reported allegations that a significant
percentage of the reviews on our platform are not genuine. Although we take steps to address the reviews that may
not be reliable through our automated recommendation software, our consumer alerts program, coordination with
law enforcement and sting operations targeting the buying and selling of reviews, we cannot ensure that each of the
36.4 million recommended reviews on our platform as of December 31, 2013 are authentic. If consumers do not
believe our recommended reviews to be reliable, they may seek other services to obtain the information for which
they are looking, and may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all. This would negatively impact
our ability to retain and attract users and advertisers and increase the frequency with which they use our platform. 
 Maintaining and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial
investments, and these investments may not be successful. For
example, our trademarks are an important element of our brand. We have faced in
the past, and may face in the future, oppositions from third parties to our
applications to register key trademarks in foreign jurisdictions in which we
expect to expand our presence. If we are unsuccessful in defending against these
oppositions, our trademark applications may be denied. Whether or not our
trademark registration applications are denied, third parties may claim that our
trademarks infringe their rights. As a result, we could be forced to pay
significant settlement costs or cease the use of these trademarks and associated
elements of our brand in those or other jurisdictions. Doing so could harm our
brand or brand recognition and adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. If we fail to maintain
and enhance our brand successfully, or if we incur excessive expenses in this
effort, our business and financial results may be adversely affected. 
 Negative publicity could
adversely affect our reputation and brand. 
 Negative publicity about our company, including our technology, sales practices, personnel, customer service or
litigation or political activities, could diminish confidence in and the use of our products. Certain media outlets have
previously reported allegations that we manipulate our reviews, rankings and ratings in favor of our advertisers and
against non-advertisers. These allegations, though untrue, could adversely affect our reputation and brand, require
significant management time and attention, and subject us to inquiries or investigations. In order to demonstrate that
our automated recommendation software applies in a nondiscriminatory manner to both advertisers and nonadvertisers,
we have made all reviews that are not recommended accessible on our platform. We have also allowed
businesses to comment publicly on negative reviews so that they can provide their response. Nevertheless, our
reputation and brand, the traffic to our website and mobile app and our business may suffer if negative publicity
about our company persists or if users otherwise perceive that content on our website and mobile app is manipulated
or biased. In addition, our website and mobile app also serve as a platform for expression by our users, and third
parties or the public at large may attribute the political or other sentiments expressed by users on our platform to us,
which could harm our reputation. Similarly, the actions of our partners may affect our brand if users do not have a
positive experience completing transactions on the Yelp Platform. 
 If we fail to maintain and expand
our base of advertisers, our revenue and our business will be harmed. 
 For the three months and full year ended December 31, 2013, substantially all
of our revenue was generated by the sale of advertising products. We have
incurred significant costs to attract current and future advertisers and expect
to incur significant additional costs for the foreseeable future. Our ability to
grow our business depends on our ability to maintain and expand our advertiser
base. To do so, we must convince existing and prospective advertisers alike that
our advertising products offer a material benefit and can generate a competitive
return relative to other alternatives. Many prospective advertisers, such as
those in new markets, may not be familiar with our products or view them as
unproven. Many of these businesses are more accustomed to using more traditional
methods of advertising, such as newspapers or print yellow pages directories. If
we do not deliver ads in an effective manner, or we do not provide accurate
analytics and measurement solutions that demonstrate the value of our ads,
advertisers may choose not to advertise with us. 
 Our advertisers typically do not have long-term obligations to purchase
our products, and their decisions to renew depend on a number of factors,
including the degree of satisfaction with our products and their ability to
continue their operations and spending levels. We rely heavily on advertising
spend by small and medium-sized local businesses, which have historically
experienced high failure rates and often have limited advertising budgets. As a
result, we may experience attrition in our advertisers in the ordinary course of
business resulting from several factors, including losses to competitors,
declining advertising budgets, closures and bankruptcies. 
 We may face greater challenges as we continue to expand our advertiser
base in businesses outside the restaurant and shopping categories, which
together accounted for approximately 43% of the businesses that have been
reviewed on our platform and approximately 59% of our cumulative reviews through
December 31, 2013, especially if these businesses believe that consumers
perceive the utility of our platform to be limited to finding businesses in the
restaurant and shopping categories. The ratings and reviews that businesses
receive from our users may also affect advertising decisions by current and
prospective advertisers. For instance, favorable ratings and reviews, on the one
hand, could be perceived as obviating the need to advertise, and unfavorable
ratings and reviews, on the other, could discourage businesses from advertising
to an audience they perceive as hostile or cause them to form a negative opinion
of our products and user base, which could discourage them from doing business
with us. 
 We must continually add new advertisers both to replace advertisers who
choose not to renew their advertising or who go out of business, or otherwise
fail to fulfill their advertising contracts with us, to grow our business. If
our advertisers increase their rates of non-renewal or if we experience
significant advertiser attrition or contract breach, or if we are unable to
attract new advertisers in numbers greater than the number of advertisers that
we lose, our client base will decrease and our business, financial condition and
results of operations would be harmed. 
 If we fail to expand effectively
into new markets, both domestically and abroad, our revenue and our business
will be harmed. 
 We
intend to expand our operations into new markets, both domestically and abroad.
We may incur losses or otherwise fail to enter new markets successfully. Our
expansion into new markets places us in competitive environments with which we
are unfamiliar and involves various risks, including the need to invest
significant resources and the possibility that returns on such investments will
not be achieved for several years, or at all. In attempting to establish a
presence in new markets, we expect, as we have in the past, to incur significant
expenses and face various other challenges, such as expanding our sales force
and community management personnel to reach those new markets and encountering
different and potentially lower levels of user engagement in some or all of
these markets. Our current and any future expansion plans will require
significant resources and management attention. Furthermore, we have already
entered many of the largest markets in the United States and further expansion
in smaller markets may not yield similar results or sustain our
growth. 
 We plan to continue expanding our
operations abroad where we have limited operating experience and may be subject
to increased risks that could affect our financial results. 
 We
plan to continue the international expansion of our operations and our offerings
in new languages. Our platform is now available in English and several other
languages. However, we may have difficulty modifying our technology and content
for use in non-English-speaking markets or fostering new communities in
non-English-speaking markets. Our ability to manage our business and conduct our
operations internationally requires considerable management attention and
resources, and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly
growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs,
legal systems, alternative dispute systems, regulatory systems and commercial
infrastructures. Furthermore, in most international markets, we would not be the
first entrant, and our competitors may be better positioned than we are to
succeed. Expanding internationally may subject us to risks that we have either
not faced before or increase our exposure to risks that we currently face,
including risks associated with: 
 recruiting and retaining qualified, multi-lingual employees, including
  sales personnel; 
 integrating businesses we may acquire internationally, such as Qype; 
 increased competition from local websites and guides, and potential
  preferences by local populations for local providers; 
 compliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations, including
  different privacy, censorship and liability standards and regulations and
  different intellectual property laws; 
 providing solutions in different languages for different cultures, which
  may require that we modify our solutions and features to ensure that they are
  culturally relevant in different countries; 
 our ability to achieve prominent display of our content in unpaid search
  results, which may be more difficult in newer markets where we may have less
  content and more competitors than in established markets; 
 the enforceability of our intellectual property rights; 
 credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud; 
 compliance with anti-bribery laws, including but not limited to compliance
  with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act; 
 currency exchange rate fluctuations; 
 foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash
  earned outside the United States; 
 political and economic instability in some countries; 
 double taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax
  consequences due to changes in the tax laws of the United States or the
  foreign jurisdictions in which we operate; and 
 higher costs of doing business internationally. 
 Mobile advertising is new and
evolving. If our mobile advertising solutions are not compelling or do not
operate effectively with mobile operating systems, growth in use of our mobile
app and mobile website, particularly if it substitutes for use of our website on
personal computers, may adversely affect our results of operations and business. 
 The number of people who access information about local businesses through
mobile devices, including smartphones and handheld tablets or computers, has
increased dramatically in the past few years and is expected to continue to
increase. Although we currently deliver advertising on our mobile app and mobile
website, the mobile advertising market remains a new and evolving market. Given
our limited experience in monetizing our mobile products and commitment to
prioritizing the quality of user experience over short-term monetization, we may
not be able to generate meaningful revenue from our mobile products despite the
expected growth in mobile usage. In addition, if consumers use our mobile app
and mobile website as substitutes for, rather than in addition to, use of our
website on personal computers and our mobile solutions prove ineffective, our
advertisers may stop or reduce their advertising with us. Similarly, we may be
unable to attract new advertisers if our mobile advertising solutions are not
compelling. If our advertising solutions are not effective or we fail to
continue to innovate and introduce enhanced mobile solutions, if our solutions
alienate our user base, or if our solutions are not widely adopted or are
insufficiently profitable, our business may suffer. 
 Additionally, we are dependent on the interoperability of our mobile products
with popular mobile operating systems that we do not control, such as Android
and iOS, and any changes in such systems that degrade their functionality could
adversely affect mobile usage. As new mobile devices and platforms are released,
it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing products
for these alternative devices and platforms, and we may need to devote
significant resources to the creation, support and maintenance of such products.
If we experience difficulties in the future in integrating our mobile app into
mobile devices or if problems arise with our relationships with providers of
mobile operating systems or mobile application download stores, such as those of
Google, with whose local products we compete, or Apple, our user growth
and user engagement could be harmed. In addition, if our applications receive
unfavorable treatment compared to the promotion and placement of competing
applications, such as the order of our products in the Apple AppStore, or if we
face increased costs to distribute our mobile app, our future growth and our
results of operations could suffer. Further, in the event that it becomes more
difficult for our users to access and use our mobile app, or if users choose to
use mobile products that do not offer access to our mobile app, we may be unable
to decrease our reliance on traffic from Google and other search
engines. 
 We expect to face increased
competition in the market. 
 The market for information regarding local businesses and advertising is
intensely competitive and rapidly changing. With the emergence of new
technologies and market entrants, competition is likely to intensify in the
future. Our competitors include, among others, offline media companies and
service providers; newspaper, television and other media companies; Internet
search engines, such as Google, Bing and Yahoo!; and various other online
service providers and review websites, including regional review websites that
may have strong positions in particular countries. 
 Our competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater name
recognition, longer operating histories, substantially greater market share,
large existing user bases and substantially greater financial, technical and
other resources. These companies may use these advantages to offer products
similar to ours at a lower price, develop different products to compete with our
current solutions and respond more quickly and effectively than we do to new or
changing opportunities, technologies, standards or client requirements. In
particular, major Internet companies, such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo! and
Microsoft may be more successful than us in developing and marketing online
advertising offerings directly to local businesses and many of our advertisers
and potential advertisers may choose to purchase online advertising services
from these competitors and may reduce their purchases of our products. In
addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established
marketing relationships with and access to larger client bases. Certain
competitors could also use strong or dominant positions in one or more markets
to gain competitive advantage against us in areas where we operate, including
by: integrating review platforms or features into products they control, such as
search engines, web browsers or mobile device operating systems; changing their
unpaid search result rankings to promote their products; refusing to enter into
or renew licenses on which we depend; or limiting or denying our access to
advertising measurement or delivery systems. 
 As
the market for local online advertising increases, new competitors, business
models and solutions are likely to emerge. We also compete with these companies
for the attention of contributors and consumers, and may experience decreases in
both if our competitors offer more compelling environments. For all of these
reasons, we may be unable to maintain or grow the number of people who use our
website and mobile app and the number of businesses that use our advertising
solutions and we may face pressure to reduce the price of our advertising
solutions, in which case our business, results of operations and financial
condition will be harmed. 
 The traffic to our website and
mobile application may decline and our business may suffer if other companies
copy information from our platform and publish or aggregate it with other
information for their own benefit. 
 From time to time, other companies copy information from our platform, through
website scraping, robots or other means, and publish or aggregate it with other
information for their own benefit. For example, in parts of 2010 and 2011,
Google incorporated content from our website into its own local product without
our permission. Googles users, as a result, may not have visited our website
because they found the information they sought on Google. While we do not
believe that Google is still incorporating our content within its local
products, we have no assurance that Google or other companies will not copy,
publish or aggregate content from our platform in the future. 
 When third parties copy, publish or aggregate content from our platform, it
makes them more competitive and decreases the likelihood that consumers will
visit our website or use our mobile app to find the information they seek, which
could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition. We may not be able to detect such third-party conduct in a timely
manner and, even if we could, we may not be able to prevent it. In some cases,
particularly in the case of websites operating outside of the United States, our
available remedies may be inadequate to protect us against such practices. In
addition, we may be required to expend significant financial or other resources
to successfully enforce our rights. 
 The impact of worldwide economic
conditions, including the resulting effect on advertising spending by local
businesses, may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial
condition. 
 Worldwide economic conditions, such as the sovereign debt and federal government
funding issues in the United States, create uncertainty and unpredictability and
add risk to our future outlook. Our performance is subject to, among other
things, the impact of worldwide economic conditions on levels of advertising
spend by small and medium-sized businesses, which may be disproportionately
affected by economic downturns. In the event of an economic slowdown or
deterioration of worldwide economic conditions, our existing and potential
advertising clients may no longer consider investment in our advertising
solutions a necessity, or may elect to reduce advertising budgets. Historically,
economic downturns have resulted in overall reductions in advertising spending.
In particular, web-based advertising solutions may be viewed by some of our
existing and potential advertising clients as a lower priority and could cause
advertisers to reduce the amounts they spend on advertising, terminate their use
of our solutions or default on their payment obligations to us. In addition,
economic conditions may adversely impact levels of consumer spending, which
could adversely impact the numbers of consumers visiting our website and mobile
app. Consumer purchases of discretionary items generally decline during
recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely
affected. If spending at many of the local businesses reviewed on our platform
declines, businesses may be less likely to use our advertising products, which
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations. 
 We face potential liability and
expense for legal claims based on the content on our platform. 
 We
face potential liability and expense for legal claims relating to the
information that we publish on our website and mobile app, including claims for
defamation, libel, negligence and copyright or trademark infringement, among
others. For example, businesses in the past have claimed, and may in the future
claim, that we are responsible for defamatory reviews posted by our users. We
expect claims like these to continue, and potentially increase in proportion to
the amount of content on our platform. These claims could divert management time
and attention away from our business and result in significant costs to
investigate and defend, regardless of the merits of the claims. In some
instances, we may elect or be compelled to remove content or may be forced to
pay substantial damages if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to defend against
these claims. If we elect or are compelled to remove valuable content from our
website or mobile app, our platform may become less useful to consumers and our
traffic may decline, which could have a negative impact on our business and
financial performance. 
 This risk may be increased if the immunities afforded to websites that publish
user-generated content are limited through new legislation or otherwise. For
example, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for
activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by
a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other
torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement and other
theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads
posted or the content provided by users. It may also be enhanced in certain
jurisdictions outside the United States where our protection from liability for
third-party actions may be unclear and where we may be less protected under
local laws than we are in the United States. 
 Our business is subject to
complex and evolving U.S. and foreign regulations and other legal obligations
related to privacy, data protection and other matters. Our actual or perceived
failure to comply with such regulations and obligations could harm our business. 
 We
are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad that involve
matters central to our business, including laws regarding privacy, data
retention, distribution of user-generated content and consumer protection, among
others. For example, because we receive, store and process personal information
and other user data, including credit card information for certain users, we are
subject to numerous federal, state and local laws around the world regarding
privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of
personal information and other user data, such as the Childrens Online Privacy
Protection Act, which regulates the way we collect and use information from
children. We are also subject to a variety of laws, regulations and guidelines
that regulate the way we distinguish paid search results and other types of
advertising from unpaid search results. 
 The application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often
uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we
operate, and may be inconsistent between countries. It is also possible that the
interpretation and application of these obligations may conflict with other
rules or our practices, such as industry standards to which we adhere, our
privacy policies and our privacy-related obligations to third parties
(including, in certain instances, voluntary third-party certification bodies
such as TRUSTe). It is difficult to predict how existing laws will be applied to
our business, and if our business grows and evolves and our solutions are used
in a greater number of countries, we will also become subject to laws and
regulations in additional jurisdictions. 
 Similarly, our business could be adversely affected if new legislation or
regulations are adopted that are inconsistent with our current business
practices and that require us to change these practices or the design of our
platform, products or features. For example, regulatory frameworks for privacy
issues are currently in flux worldwide, and are likely to remain so for the
foreseeable future due to increased public scrutiny of the practices of
companies offering online services with respect to the personal information of
their users. The U.S. government, including the White House, the Federal Trade Commissions, or FTC, and the
Department of Commerce, and many state governments are reviewing the need for
greater regulation of the collection of information concerning consumer behavior
with respect to online services, including regulation aimed at restricting
certain targeted advertising practices and the collection and use of data from
mobile services. In addition, the European Union is in the process of
promulgating a new general data protection regulation, which may result in
significantly greater compliance burdens for companies such as us with users and
operations in Europe. Changes like these could increase our administrative costs
and make it more difficult for consumers to use our platform, resulting in less
traffic and revenue. Similarly, such changes could make it more difficult for us
to provide effective advertising tools to businesses on our platform, resulting
in fewer advertisers and less revenue. 
 We
believe our policies and practices comply with applicable laws and regulations.
However, if our belief proves incorrect, if these guidelines, laws or
regulations or their interpretation change or new legislation or regulations are
enacted, or if the third parties with whom we share user information fail to
comply with such guidelines, laws, regulations or their contractual obligations
to us, we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our legal exposure.
This may require us to expend substantial resources, delay development of new
products or discontinue certain products or features, which would negatively
affect our business. For example, if we fail to comply with our privacy-related
obligations to users or third parties, or any compromise of security that
results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable
information or other user data, we may be compelled to provide additional
disclosures to our users, obtain additional consents from our users before
collecting or using their information or implement new safeguards to help our
users manage our use of their information, among other changes. We may also face
governmental enforcement actions, litigation or negative publicity, which could
cause our users and advertisers to lose trust in us and have an adverse effect
on our business. The FTC in particular has approved consent decrees resolving
complaints and their resulting investigations into the privacy and security
practices of a number of social media companies. Similar investigations, decrees
or actions may adversely impact us directly. 
 Our growth depends in part on the
success of our strategic relationships with third parties, and any failure to
maintain these relationships could harm our business. 
 We
rely in part on relationships with various third parties to grow our business,
including strategic partners and technology and content providers. Identifying,
negotiating and maintaining relationships with third parties require significant
time and resources, as does integrating their services and technologies onto our
platform. We may also have competing interests and obligations with respect to
our partners, which may make it difficult to maintain, grow or maximize the
benefit of each partnership. In addition, we have had, and may in the future
have, disagreements or disputes with our partners about our respective
contractual obligations, which could result in legal proceedings or negatively
affect our brand and reputation. It is also possible that these third parties
may not be able to devote the resources we expect to the relationships or they
may terminate their relationships with us. If we are unsuccessful in
establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties, our ability to
grow our business could be impaired, and our operating results could
suffer. 
 We may acquire other companies or
technologies, which could divert our managements attention, result in
additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and
harm our operating results. We may also be unable to realize the expected
benefits and synergies of any acquisitions. 
 Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our product offerings
and grow our business in response to changing technologies, user and advertiser
demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may determine to do
so through the acquisition of complementary businesses or technologies rather
than through internal development. For example, in October 2012, we acquired
Qype to accelerate our international expansion and, in July 2013, we acquired
SeatMe to obtain an online reservation solution. We have limited experience as a
company in the complex process of acquiring other businesses and technologies.
The pursuit of potential future acquisitions may divert the attention of
management and cause us to incur expenses in identifying, investigating and
pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated.
Acquisitions that are consummated could result in dilutive issuances of equity
securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our results
of operations or our ability to achieve profitability. The incurrence of debt in
particular could result in increased fixed obligations or include covenants or
other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. 
 In
order to realize any gains from any acquisition, we must successfully complete
the integration of the acquired business, its operations, services and personnel
with our organization. In order to realize the expected benefits and synergies
of our acquisitions, we must meet a number of significant challenges, including: 
 integrating operations, strategies, sites and technologies, and personnel
  of the acquired company; 
 managing the combined business effectively; 
 retaining and assimilating the key personnel of the acquired
company; 
 retaining existing customers and strategic partners and minimizing
  disruption to existing relationships as a result of any integration of new
  personnel; 
 difficulties in the assimilation of employees and corporate
cultures; 
 implementing and retaining uniform standards, controls, procedures,
  policies and information systems; 
 addressing risks related to the business of acquired company that may
  continue to impact the businesses following the acquisition; and 
 potential unknown liabilities associated with an acquired company. 
 Any inability to integrate services, sites
and technologies, operations or personnel in an efficient and timely manner
could harm our results of operations. Transition activities are complex and
require significant time and resources, and we may not manage the process
successfully. In addition, we may be required to spend additional time or funds
on integration that otherwise would be spent on the development and expansion of
the combined business. Even if we are able to integrate the operations of any
acquired company successfully, these integrations may not result in the
realization of the full benefits of synergies, cost savings, innovation and
operational efficiencies that may be possible from the integration of each
business, and these benefits may not be achieved within a reasonable period of
time. 
 If we fail to manage our growth
effectively, our brand, results of operations and business could be harmed. 
 We
have experienced rapid growth in our headcount and operations, including through
our acquisitions of Qype in October 2012 and SeatMe in July 2013, which places
substantial demands on management and our operational infrastructure. Most of
our employees have been with us for fewer than two years. We intend to make
substantial investments in our technology, sales and marketing and community
management organizations. As we continue to grow, we must effectively integrate,
develop and motivate a large number of new employees, including employees in
international markets and from any acquired businesses, while maintaining the
beneficial aspects of our company culture. If we do not manage the growth of our
business and operations effectively, the quality of our platform and efficiency
of our operations could suffer, which could harm our brand, results of
operations and business. 
 Our business is dependent on the
uninterrupted and proper operation of our technology and network infrastructure.
Any significant disruption in our service could damage our reputation, result a
potential loss of users and engagement and adversely affect our results of
operations. 
 It
is important to our success that users in all geographies be able to access our
platform at all times. We have previously experienced, and may experience in the
future, service disruptions, outages and other performance problems. Such
performance problems may be due to a variety of factors, including
infrastructure changes, human or software errors and capacity constraints due to
an overwhelming number of users accessing our platform simultaneously. In some
instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these
performance problems within an acceptable period of time. If our platform is
unavailable when users attempt to access it or it does not load as quickly as
they expect, users may seek other services to obtain the information for which
they are looking, and may not return to our platform as often in the future, or
at all. This would negatively impact our ability to attract users and
advertisers and increase the frequency with which they use our website and
mobile app. 
 It
may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve the availability of
our platform, especially during peak usage times, as our solutions become more
complex and our user traffic increases. We expect to continue to make
significant investments to maintain and improve the availability of our platform
and to enable rapid releases of new features and products. To the extent that we
do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed
and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate
actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and operating results
may be harmed. 
 Our systems and operations are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from catastrophic occurrences such as
earthquakes, fires, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks and similar events. Our U.S.
corporate offices and one of the facilities we lease to house our computer and telecommunications equipment are
located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. In addition, acts of terrorism, which may
be targeted at metropolitan areas that have higher population density than rural areas, could cause disruptions in our
or our local business advertisers’ businesses or the economy as a whole. We may not have sufficient protection or
recovery plans in certain circumstances, such as natural disasters affecting the San Francisco Bay Area, and our
business interruption insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Our disaster
recovery program contemplates transitioning our platform and data to a backup center in the event of a catastrophe.
Although this program is functional, if our primary data center shuts down, there will be a period of time that our
services will remain shut down while the transition to the back-up data center takes place. During this time, our
platform may be unavailable in whole or in part to our users. 
 We are, and may in the future be,
subject to disputes and assertions by third parties that we violate their
rights. These disputes may be costly to defend and could harm our business and
operating results. 
 We
currently face, and we expect to face from time to time in the future,
allegations that we have violated the rights of third parties, including patent,
trademark, copyright and other intellectual property rights and the rights of
current and former employees, users and business owners. For example, certain of
our users have sued us claiming that they were in fact Yelp employees and should
have received minimum wage for their time spent writing reviews. Other users
have brought suit alleging that we violated their privacy rights when our mobile
app accessed certain data on their mobile devices. Various businesses have also
sued us alleging that we manipulate Yelp reviews in order to coerce them and
other businesses to pay for Yelp advertising. 
 Companies in the Internet, technology and media industries own large numbers of
patent and other intellectual property rights, and frequently enter into
litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of such
rights. In addition, various non-practicing entities that own patents and
other intellectual property rights often aggressively attempt to assert their
rights in order to extract value from technology companies. From time to time,
we receive notice letters from patent holders alleging that certain of our
products and services infringe their patent rights. We do not own any patents, and,
therefore, may be unable to deter competitors or
others from pursuing patent or other intellectual
property infringement claims against us. We presently are involved in
numerous patent lawsuits, all of which involve plaintiffs targeting multiple
defendants in the same or similar suits. 
 Other claims against us can be expected to be made in the future, and as we face
increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, we expect the
number of claims against us to accelerate. The results of litigation and claims
to which we may be subject cannot be predicted with certainty. Even if the
claims are without merit, the costs associated with defending these types of
claims may be substantial, both in terms of time, money and management
distraction. In particular, patent and other intellectual property litigation
may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict and
may require us to stop offering certain features, purchase licenses or modify
our products and features while we develop non-infringing substitutes or may
result in significant settlement costs. Even if these
matters do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without
significant cash settlements, these matters, and the time and resources
necessary to litigate or resolve them, could harm our business, results of
operations and reputation. 
 Some of our products contain open
source software, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software and
solutions. 
 We
use open source software in our products and will use open source software in
the future. From time to time, we may face claims from third parties claiming
ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or
derivative works that we developed using such software (which could include our
proprietary source code), or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the
applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation and
could require us to purchase a costly license or cease offering the implicated
solutions unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement. This
re-engineering process could require significant additional research and
development resources. In addition to risks related to license requirements, use
of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of
third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not
provide warranties or controls on the origin of software. Any of these risks
could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could have a
negative effect on our business and operating results. 
 We make the consumer experience
our highest priority. Our dedication to making decisions based primarily on the
best interests of consumers may cause us to forgo short-term gains and
advertising revenue. 
 We
base many of our decisions upon the best interests of the consumers who use our
platform. We believe that this approach has been essential to our success in
increasing our user growth rate and the frequency with which consumers use our
platform and has served the long-term interests of our company and our
stockholders. In the past, we have forgone, and we may in the future forgo,
certain expansion or revenue opportunities that we do not believe are in the
best interests of consumers, even if such decisions negatively impact our
results of operations in the short term, and we believe that continued adherence
to this principle will, in the long term, benefit our stockholders. In
particular, our approach of putting our consumers first may negatively impact
our relationships with our existing or prospective advertisers. For example,
unless we believe that a review violates our terms of service, such as reviews
that contain hate speech or bigotry, we allow the review to remain on the
platform, even if the business disputes its accuracy. Certain advertisers may
therefore perceive us as an impediment to their success as a result of negative
reviews and ratings. This practice could result in a loss of advertisers, which
in turn could harm our results of operations. 
 We rely on third-party service
providers for many aspects of our business, and any failure to maintain these
relationships could harm our business. 
 We
rely on data about local businesses from third parties, including various yellow
pages and other third parties that license such information to us. We also rely
on third parties for other aspects of our business, such as mapping
functionality and administrative software solutions. If these third parties
experience difficulty meeting our requirements or standards, or our licenses are
revoked or not renewed, it could make it difficult for us to operate some
aspects of our business, which could damage our reputation. In addition, if such
third-party service providers were to cease operations, temporarily or
permanently, face financial distress or other business disruption, increase
their fees or if our relationships with these providers deteriorate, we could
suffer increased costs and delays in our ability to provide consumers and
advertisers with content or provide similar services until an equivalent
provider could be found or we could develop replacement technology or
operations. 
 We expect a number of factors to
cause our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which
may make it difficult to predict our future performance. 
 Our operating results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year
to year because of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our
control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period
basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors discussed in this
section, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and
annual results include: 
 our ability to attract new local business advertisers and retain existing
  advertisers; 
 our ability to accurately forecast revenue and adjusted EBITDA, as well as appropriately estimate and plan
our expenses; 
 the effects of changes in search engine placement and
prominence; 
 the effects of increased competition in our business; 
 our ability to successfully expand in existing markets, enter new markets
  and manage our international expansion; 
 our ability to maintain and increase traffic to our website and mobile
  app; 
 our ability to manage and integrate successfully any acquisitions of businesses, solutions or technologies,
such as Qype and SeatMe; 
 the impact of worldwide economic conditions, including the resulting
  effect on consumer spending at local businesses and the level of advertising
  spending by local businesses; 
 our ability to protect and grow our intellectual property; 
 our ability to maintain an adequate rate of growth and effectively manage
  that growth; 
 our ability to keep pace with changes in technology; 
 the success of our sales and marketing efforts; 
 costs associated with defending intellectual property infringement and
  other claims and related judgments or settlements; 
 changes in government regulation affecting our business; 
 interruptions in service and any related impact on our reputation; 
 the attraction and retention of qualified employees and key
  personnel; 
 our ability to choose and effectively manage third-party service
  providers; 
 the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates; 
 changes in consumer behavior with respect to local businesses; 
 fluctuations in spending by our advertisers due to seasonality, such as
  historically stronger spending in the fourth quarter of each year, or other
  factors; 
 the effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events; 
 the effectiveness of our internal controls; and 
 changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax
liabilities. 
 Because we recognize most of the
revenue from our advertising products over the term of an agreement, a
significant downturn in our business may not be immediately reflected in our
results of operations. 
 We
recognize revenue from sales of our advertising products over the terms of the
applicable agreements, which are generally three, six or 12 months. As a result,
a significant portion of the revenue we report in each quarter is generated from
agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new
or renewed agreements in any one quarter may not significantly impact our
revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future
quarters. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our fixed costs in response to
reduced revenue. Accordingly, the effect of significant declines in advertising
sales may not be reflected in our short-term results of operations. 
 We
rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel, and if we are unable to
attract, retain and motivate well-qualified employees, our business could be
harmed. 
 We
believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and
talents of our employees, including our senior management team, software
engineers, marketing professionals and advertising sales staff. Our future
success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and
retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high
demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. As we mature, the
incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees provided by our equity
awards, for example, may not be as effective as in the past, and if we issue
significant equity to attract additional employees, the ownership of our
existing stockholders may be further diluted and our expenses may significantly increase. 
 In
addition, the loss of any of our senior management or key employees could
materially adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan, and we may
not be able to find adequate replacements. All of our officers and other U.S.
employees are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment
relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and
industry would be extremely difficult to replace. We cannot ensure that we will
be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other
key employees. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or
retaining and motivating existing employees, our business could be harmed. 
 Failure to protect or enforce our
intellectual property rights could harm our business and results of operations. 
 We
regard the protection of our trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and domain
names as critical to our success. In particular, we must maintain, protect and
enhance the Yelp brand. We pursue the registration of our domain names,
trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain jurisdictions
abroad. We strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on
federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We
typically enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with
our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with parties with
whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of,
our proprietary information. However, these contractual arrangements and the
other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent
the misappropriation or disclosure of our proprietary information nor deter
independent development of similar technologies by others. 
 Effective trade secret, copyright, trademark and domain name protection is
expensive to develop and maintain, both in terms of initial and ongoing
registration requirements and expenses and the costs of defending our rights. We
are seeking to protect our trademarks and domain names in an increasing number
of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be successful or which
we may not pursue in every location. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our
intellectual property rights, protect our respective trade secrets or determine
the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation
of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial
costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could
adversely affect our business and operating results. We may incur significant
costs in enforcing our trademarks against those who attempt to imitate our
Yelp brand. If we fail to maintain, protect and enhance our intellectual
property rights, our business and operating results may be harmed. 
 We may be unable to continue to
use the domain names that we use in our business, or prevent third parties from
acquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise
decrease the value of our brand or our trademarks or service marks. 
 We
have registered domain names for our website that we use in our business, such
as Yelp.com. If we lose the ability to use a domain name, whether due to
trademark claims, failure to renew the applicable registration, or any other
cause, we may be forced to market our products under a new domain name, which
could cause us substantial harm, or to incur significant expense in order to
purchase rights to the domain name in question. In addition, our competitors and
others could attempt to capitalize on our brand recognition by using domain
names similar to ours. Domain names similar to ours have been registered in the
United States and elsewhere. We may be unable to prevent third parties from
acquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise
decrease the value of our brand or our trademarks or service marks. Protecting
and enforcing our rights in our domain names may require litigation, which could
result in substantial costs and diversion of managements attention. 
 If our security measures are
compromised, or if our platform is subject to attacks that degrade or deny the
ability of users to access our content, users may curtail or stop use of our
platform. 
 Our platform involves the storage and
transmission of user and business information, some of which may be private, and
security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, which
could result in potential liability and litigation. Like all online services,
our platform is vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, phishing attacks,
attempts to overload our servers with denial-of-service or other attacks and
similar disruptions from unauthorized use of our computer systems, any of which
could lead to interruptions, delays or website shutdowns, causing loss of
critical data or the unauthorized disclosure or use of personally identifiable
or other confidential information. Because the techniques used to obtain
unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change
frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may
originate from less regulated and more remote areas around the world, we may be
unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate
preventative measures. User and business owner accounts and profile pages could
also be hacked, hijacked, altered or otherwise claimed or controlled by
unauthorized persons. For example, we enable businesses to create free online
business accounts and claim the business profile pages for each of their
business locations. We verify these claims through an automated telephone
verification process, which is designed to confirm that the person setting up
the account is affiliated with the business by confirming that the person has
access to the businesss telephone. Our verification system could fail to
confirm that the recipient of the call is an authorized representative of the
business, or mistakenly allow an unauthorized representative to claim the
businesss profile page. 
 Any or all of these issues could negatively impact our ability to attract new
users or could deter current users from returning or reduce the frequency with
which consumers and advertisers use our solutions, cause existing or potential
advertisers to cancel their contracts or subject us to third-party lawsuits or
other action or liability, thereby harming our results of operations. Government
authorities could also initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in
connection with such incidents, which could cause us to incur significant
expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to
modify our business practices. For example, we work with third party vendors to
process credit card payments by certain of our users and local businesses and
are subject to payment card association operating rules. If our security
measures fail to protect this information adequately as a result of employee
error, malfeasance or otherwise, or we fail to comply with the applicable
operating rules, we could be liable to our users and local businesses for their
losses, as well as the vendors under our agreements with them; be subject to
fines and higher transaction fees; face regulatory action; and our users, local
businesses and vendors could end their relationships with us, any of which could
harm our business and financial results. 
 Domestic and foreign laws may be
interpreted and enforced in ways that impose new obligations on us with respect
to Yelp Deals, which may harm our business and results of operations. 
 Our Yelp Deals products may be deemed gift certificates, store gift cards,
general-use prepaid cards or other vouchers, or gift cards, subject to, among
other laws, the federal Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure
Act of 2009, or the Credit CARD Act, and similar federal, state and foreign laws.
Many of these laws include specific disclosure requirements and prohibitions or
limitations on the use of expiration dates and the imposition of certain fees.
For example, the Credit CARD Act requires that gift cards expire no earlier than
five years after their issue. Yelp Deals are comprised of two components: (i)
the purchase value, which is the amount paid by the purchaser and which does not
expire, and (ii) the promotional value, which is the remaining value for which
the Yelp Deal can be redeemed during a limited period, which typically ends one
year after the date of purchase. If, contrary to our belief, the Credit CARD Act
and similar state laws were held to apply to the promotional value component of
Yelp Deals, consumers would be entitled to redeem the promotional value
component of their Yelp Deals for up to five years after their issue, and we
could face liability for redemption periods that are less than five years.
Various companies that provide deal products similar to ours are currently
defendants in purported class action lawsuits that have been filed in federal
and state court claiming that their deal products are subject to the Credit CARD
Act and various state laws governing gift cards and that the defendants have
violated these laws as a result of expiration dates and other restrictions they
have placed on their deals. Similar lawsuits have been filed in other locations
in which we plan to sell our Yelp Deals, such as the Canadian province of
Ontario, alleging similar violations of provincial legislation governing gift
cards. 
 The application of various other laws and regulations to our products, and
particularly our Yelp Deals and Gift Certificates, is uncertain. These include
laws and regulations pertaining to unclaimed and abandoned property, partial
redemption, refunds, revenue-sharing restrictions on certain trade groups and
professions, sales and other local taxes and the sale of alcoholic beverages.
For example, although it is the responsibility of merchants to redeem or refund
unexpired Yelp Deals and Gift Certificates that they offer through our platform,
the law might be interpreted to require that we redeem or refund them. Because
merchants alone, and not Yelp, are in a position to track the redemption of Yelp
Deals and Gift Certificates, we may not be able to comply with such a
requirement without substantial and potentially costly changes to our
infrastructure and business practices. In addition, we may become, or be
determined to be, subject to federal, state or foreign laws regulating money
transmitters or aimed at preventing money laundering or terrorist financing,
including the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and other similar future
laws or regulations. 
 If
we become subject to claims or are required to alter our business practices as a
result of current or future laws and regulations, our revenue could decrease,
our costs could increase and our business could otherwise be harmed. In
addition, the costs and expenses associated with defending any actions related
to such additional laws and regulations and any payments of related penalties,
fines, judgments or settlements could harm our business. 
 We may require additional capital
to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on
acceptable terms, if at all. 
 We
intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may
require or otherwise seek additional funds to respond to business challenges,
including the need to develop new features and products or enhance our existing
services, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary
businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or
debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through
future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing
stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we
issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our
Class A common stock. Any debt financing we secure in the future could involve
restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other
financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to
obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including
potential acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on
terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing
or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to
continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges
could be significantly impaired, and our business may be harmed. 
 The intended tax benefits of our
corporate structure and intercompany arrangements depend on the application of
the tax laws of various jurisdictions and on how we operate our business. 
 Our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in
which we develop and use our intellectual property and the transfer pricing of
our intercompany transactions, are intended to reduce our worldwide effective
tax rate. The application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions, including
the United States, to our international business activities is subject to
interpretation and depends on our ability to operate our business in a manner
consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. The
taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our
methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements,
including our transfer pricing, or determine that the manner in which we operate
our business does not achieve the intended tax consequences, which could
increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and
results of operations. 
 Our corporate structure includes legal entities located in jurisdictions with
income tax rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. Our intercompany
arrangements allocate income to such entities in accordance with arms-length
principles and commensurate with functions performed, risks assumed and
ownership of valuable corporate assets. We believe that income taxed in certain
foreign jurisdictions at a lower rate relative to the U.S. statutory rate will
have a beneficial impact on our worldwide effective tax rate. 
 Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining
our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there
are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination
is uncertain. For example, our effective tax rates could be adversely affected
by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower
statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher
statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or by changes in
the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and
interpretations. As we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions, the application
of tax laws can be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting
interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions. It is not uncommon
for taxing authorities in different countries to have conflicting views, for
instance, with respect to, among other things, the manner in which the arms
length standard is applied for transfer pricing purposes, or with respect to the
valuation of intellectual property. In addition, tax laws are dynamic and
subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are
issued or applied. In particular, there is uncertainty in relation to the U.S.
tax legislation not only in terms of the future corporate tax rate, but also the U.S. tax consequences of income derived from income related to intellectual
property earned overseas in low tax jurisdictions. 
 Our existing corporate structure and intercompany arrangements have been
implemented in a manner we believe is in compliance with current prevailing tax
laws. However, the tax benefits which we intend to eventually derive could be
undermined if we are unable to adapt the manner in which we operate our business
and due to changing tax laws. 
 Changes in tax laws or tax
rulings could materially affect our financial position and results of
operations. 
 The current U.S. administration and key members of Congress have made public
statements indicating that tax reform is a priority. Certain changes to U.S. tax
laws, including limitations on the ability to defer U.S. taxation on earnings
outside of the United States until those earnings are repatriated to the United
States, as well as changes to U.S. tax laws that may be enacted in the future,
could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. In addition, many
countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and
organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,
are actively considering changes to existing tax laws, that if enacted could
increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business. Due to the
expanding scale of our international business activities, any changes in the
taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and
harm our financial position and results of operations. 
 If our goodwill or intangible
assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to
earnings. 
 Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, we review our
intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered
include a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may
not be recoverable include declines in our stock price and market capitalization or future cash flows projections. We
recorded a significant amount of goodwill related to our acquisition of Qype in the fourth quarter of 2012 and our
acquisition of SeatMe in the third quarter of 2013. A decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in
market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of our critical assumptions or estimates,
could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge to our goodwill and
intangible assets. Any such material charges may have a material negative impact on our financial and operating
results. 
 Risks Related to Ownership of Our
Class A Common Stock 
 The dual class structure of our
common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our stock prior to our 
 , including
our founders, directors, executive officers and employees and their affiliates,
and limiting your ability to influence corporate matters. 
 initial public offering 
 Our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock
has one vote per share. Stockholders who hold shares of Class B common stock,
including our founders, directors, executive officers and employees and their
affiliates, together beneficially own shares representing approximately 66% of
the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2013.
Consequently, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to
be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval even
though their stock holdings represent less than 50% of the outstanding shares of
our common stock. Because of the 10-to-1 voting ratio between our Class B and
Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively will
continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock
even when the shares of Class B common stock represent a small minority of all
outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated
control will limit your ability to influence corporate matters for the
foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our Class A common
stock could be adversely affected. Future transfers by holders of Class B common
stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock,
which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power
of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long
term, which may include existing founders, officers and directors and their
affiliates. 
 Our share price has been and will likely continue to be volatile. 
 The trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to
continue to be, highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in
response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. During fiscal
year 2013, our Class A common stocks daily closing price has ranged from $19.70
to $74.89. In addition to the factors discussed in this  
 Risk Factors 
  section and
elsewhere in this Annual Report, factors that may cause volatility in our share
price include: 
 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and
  operating results; 
 changes in projected operating and financial results; 
 actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our
  competitors; 
 announcements of technological innovations or new offerings by us or our
  competitors; 
 announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions,
  strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital-raising activities or
  commitments; 
 additions or departures of key personnel; 
 issuance of research or reports by securities analysts; 
 fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be
  comparable to us; 
 sales of our Class A or Class B common stock; 
 changes in laws or regulations applicable to our solutions; 
 share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading
  volume levels of our shares; and 
 general economic and market conditions. 
 Furthermore, the stock markets recently have experienced extreme price and
volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices
of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been
unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.
These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic,
political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or
international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of
our Class A common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced
volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities
class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the
future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and
divert our managements attention from other business concerns, which could harm
our business. 
 We do not intend to pay dividends
for the foreseeable future, and as a result your ability to achieve a return on
your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our Class A common
stock. 
 We
have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not
intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that
we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our
business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends
in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly,
investors must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price
appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains
on their investments. 
 Anti-takeover provisions in our
charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more
difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current
management and limit the market price of our Class A common stock. 
 Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of
delaying or preventing a change in control or changes in our management. Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated
bylaws include provisions that: 
 authorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the
  stockholders, up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred
stock; 
 require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a
  duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent; 
 specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by
  our board of directors, the Chair of our board of directors, or our Chief
  Executive Officer; 
 establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be
  brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons
  for election to our board of directors; 
 establish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, with
  directors in each class serving three-year staggered terms; 
 prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors; 
 provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a
  majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; 
 require the approval of our board of directors or the holders of a
  supermajority of our outstanding shares of capital stock to amend our bylaws
  and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation; and 
 reflect two classes of common stock, as discussed above. 
 These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to
replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for
stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible
for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are
incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of
the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware
corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with
any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on
which the stockholder became an interested stockholder. 
 If securities or industry
analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish
negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could
decline. 
 The trading market for our Class A common stock, to some extent, depends on the
research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or
our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of
the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our
shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts
cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we
could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share
price or trading volume to decline. 
 Future sales of our Class A
common stock in the public market could cause our share price to decline. 
 Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the
public market, particularly sales by our directors, officers and employees and
significant stockholders, or the perception that these sales might occur, could
depress the market price of our Class A common stock and could impair our
ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. As of
December 31, 2013, we had 59,163,134 shares of Class A common stock and
11,711,359 shares of Class B common stock outstanding. Although a public market
exists for our Class A common stock only, shares of Class B common stock are
generally convertible into an equivalent number of shares of Class A common
stock at the option of the holder or upon transfer (subject to certain
exceptions). 
 The requirements of being a
public company may strain our resources, divert managements attention and
affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members. 
 We
are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the New York
Stock Exchange and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance
with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our
legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult,
time-consuming or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources. The
Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure
controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet
this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required.
As a result, managements attention may be diverted from other business
concerns, which could harm our business and operating results. Although we have
hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to
hire more employees in the future, which will increase our costs and
expenses. 
 In
addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate
governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies,
increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more
time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying
interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a
result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is
provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing
uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by
ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest
resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this
investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a
diversion of managements time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply
with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by
regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice,
regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our
business may be harmed. 
 We
also expect that being a public company that is subject to these new rules and
regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer
liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur
substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it
more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of
directors and qualified executive officers.
