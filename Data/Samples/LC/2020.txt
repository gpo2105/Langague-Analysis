LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n Item 1A. Risk Factors \n You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Report), including the section titled “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. While we believe the risks and uncertainties described below include all material risks currently known by us, it is possible that these may not be the only ones we face. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. \n Risk Factors Summary \n Our business is subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to: \n Risks Related to Regulation, Supervision and Compliance \n • operating within the bank regulatory regime and to the satisfaction of the banking regulators; \n • our compliance with applicable laws and regulations (including foreign laws); \n • the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses; \n • operating within capital and liquidity regulations and requirements; \n • the impact of any changes to the legal and regulatory regime; \n • our participation in the Federal Paycheck Protection Program; and \n • the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management framework. \n Risks Related to Operating Our Business \n • M&A activity, including our recent acquisition of Radius Bancorp; \n • the impact of litigation and regulatory investigations; \n • holding loans on our balance sheet and associated credit, liquidity and interest rate risk; \n • our ability to develop and commercialize products and services; \n • maintaining our deposit base; \n • maintaining adequate liquidity; \n • offering a breadth and volume of investment opportunities for platform investors; \n • managing and the impact of fraudulent activity; \n • forecasting demand for loans; \n • maintaining and increasing loan originations; \n • the ability of platform investors to exert influence over us; \n • disruptions to the technology that powers our marketplace; \n • maintaining, protecting and promoting our brand; \n • our use of the issuing bank partnership model; \n • breaches of certain representations and warranties made to others; and \n • our ability to manage indebtedness. \n Risks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions or Other External Factors \n • the impact of COVID-19 and our ability to navigate the current economic environment; \n • fluctuations in interest rates; \n • the political environment and fiscal/monetary policies; \n • a decline in overall social and economic conditions; \n • the impact of natural disasters, infrastructure failures and other business interruptions; and \n • negative publicity and media coverage. \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n Risks Related to Credit and Collections \n • the accuracy and effectiveness of our credit decisioning models; and \n • the effectiveness of our collections efforts. \n Risks Related to Our Industry \n • our ability to compete; and \n • the soundness of other financial institutions. \n Risks Related to Personnel and Third-Parties \n • attracting and retaining employees; \n • the impact of any misconduct or errors; and \n • our reliance on and relationship with third-parties. \n Risks Related to Data, Intellectual Property and Privacy \n • security incidents, failures and bugs in our systems; \n • the impact of cyber-attacks suffered by third parties; \n • the collection, storage and use of personal data; \n • protecting our intellectual property rights; and \n • our use of open source software. \n Risks Related to Tax and Accounting \n • our ability to use our deferred tax asset; and \n • our net loss position. \n Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock \n • the volatility of our stock price and fluctuations in quarterly results; \n • future equity dilution; \n • our anti-takeover provisions and restrictions in accumulating a position in the Company; \n • the availability and content of research and reports by analysis; and \n • our intention to not pay dividends in the foreseeable future. \n RISKS RELATED TO REGULATION, SUPERVISION AND COMPLIANCE \n We operate in a highly regulated environment that affects virtually all aspects of our operations, and the need to comply with applicable laws, regulations and supervisory expectations can materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations \n We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and legal requirements that affect virtually all aspects of our operations. The regulatory regime governing banking organizations is generally intended to protect customers, depositors, the DIF, and the overall financial stability of the United States, not our shareholders or creditors. See “ Item 1. Business – Regulation and Supervision” for information on the regulation and supervision framework which governs our Company and its activities. \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n We are regularly examined and inspected by our regulators, including the FRB and OCC. Our regulators have extensive authority and discretion in their interpretation, implementation, supervision and enforcement of the regulatory regime, including on matters related to: \n • dividends or capital distributions by the Bank or the Company; \n • capital and liquidity requirements applicable to us, including the imposition of requirements more stringent than those required under generally applicable laws; \n • the types and terms of products we offer, activities we may conduct or investments we may make; \n • the composition, risk characteristics, potential adverse classification, allowance and risk reserves in connection with our loans or other assets; \n • our deposit-gathering and other funding sources; \n • the quality of our board and management oversight; \n • the effectiveness of our risk management and compliance programs, including with respect to consumer protection, information technology, cybersecurity, third-party risk management, anti-money laundering and sanctions; \n • the Bank's commitment to helping meet the credit needs of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1967; \n • their willingness to approve applications, such as for changes in our business plan, the establishment of new branches, the commencement of new activities, or the conduct of mergers and acquisitions; and \n • our rate of growth and other expansionary or strategic initiatives. \n The Company became a bank holding company on February 1, 2021, with its acquisition of the Bank, and therefore has only recently become subject to the bank regulatory regime. We must devote substantial time and resources to compliance and meeting our regulators' supervisory expectations, which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably or to pursue advantageous business opportunities. \n Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or commitments, or to satisfy our regulators' supervisory expectations, could subject us to, among other things, supervisory or enforcement action, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n If we do not comply with applicable laws, regulations or commitments, if we are deemed to have engaged in unsafe or unsound conduct, or if we do not satisfy our regulators' supervisory expectations, then we may be subject to increased scrutiny, supervisory criticism, governmental or private litigation and/or a wide range of potential monetary penalties or consequences, enforcement actions, criminal liability and/or reputational harm. Such actions could be public or of a confidential nature, and arise even if we are acting in good faith or operating under a reasonable interpretation of the law and could include, for example, monetary penalties, payment of damages or other monetary relief, restitution or disgorgement of profits, directives to take remedial action or to cease or modify practices, restrictions on growth or expansionary proposals, denial or refusal to accept applications, removal of officers or directors, prohibition on dividends or capital distributions, increases in capital or liquidity requirements and/or termination of the Bank's deposit insurance. Additionally, compliance with applicable laws, regulations and commitments requires significant investment of management attention and resources. Any failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or commitments could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses. \n We maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loan defaults and non-performance. We reserve for loan losses by establishing an allowance that is based on our assessment of loan losses in our loan portfolio. Further, through its adoption of the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model, the FASB has implemented a new accounting model to measure credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, which includes the vast majority of our loan portfolio. Under this new model, the allowance is established to reserve for management’s best estimate of expected lifetime losses inherent in our finance receivables and loan portfolio. \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n The process for determining the amount of the allowance requires subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, revisions to accounting rules and related guidance, the implementation of CECL, new qualitative or quantitative information about existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, changes in the size or composition of our finance receivables and loan portfolio, changes to our loss estimation techniques including consideration of forecasted economic assumptions, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. \n A decline in the national economy and the local economies of the areas in which the loans are concentrated could result in an increase in loan delinquencies, foreclosures or repossessions resulting in increased charge-off amounts and the need for additional loan loss allowances in future periods. In addition, our regulators may require us to make a provision for loan losses or otherwise recognize further loan charge-offs following their periodic review of our loan portfolio, our underwriting procedures, and our loan loss allowance. \n We are subject to stringent capital and liquidity regulations and requirements. \n LendingClub Corporation is the parent company of and a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank. Legal entity liquidity is an important consideration as there are legal, regulatory, contractual and other limitations on our ability to utilize liquidity from one legal entity to satisfy the liquidity requirements of another, which could result in adverse liquidity events at either LendingClub Corporation and/or the Bank. In particular, the Bank is subject to laws that restrict dividend payments, or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries. Applicable laws and regulations, including capital and liquidity requirements, could restrict our ability to transfer funds between the Bank and LendingClub Corporation, which could adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition. Additionally, applicable laws and regulations may restrict what LendingClub Corporation is able to do with the liquidity it does possess, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations. \n Bank holding companies, including the Company, are subject to capital and liquidity standards. Further, we have made certain commitments to the banking regulators which require us to hold capital incremental to the minimum required under the applicable standards, which could thereby impact the Company’s ability to invest in assets. From time to time, regulators may implement changes to these capital adequacy and liquidity requirements. If the Company fails to meet these minimum capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements, its business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand could be limited. It could also result in the Company being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive or adverse to stockholders, including limiting the Company’s ability to pay dividends to stockholders or limiting the Company’s ability to invest in assets even if deemed more desirable from a financial and business perspective. \n Changes in the legal and regulatory regime could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n Laws, regulations and supervisory expectations, and the manner in which they are interpreted and enforced, are constantly changing. For example, governments could pass legislation or adopt policies based on changes in leadership, shifting priorities or in response to current financial conditions. We cannot predict what changes, if any, will be made to the legal and regulatory regime or the effect that such changes may have on our future business and earnings prospects. Changes to the legal and regulatory regime may require material modifications to our products, services and operations, require significant investments of management attention and resources, or expose us to potential liability for past practices. Changes to the legal and regulatory regime, such as through amendments to laws and regulations, imposition of supervisory action, or shifts in governmental or regulatory policies, practices or priorities may have a material adverse impact on our operations, including the cost to conduct business, our results of operations and what products and services we can offer. \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n We have participated as a lender in the Federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and have certain risks attributable to lenders under PPP. \n The PPP loans made by the Bank (which in this risk factor includes its predecessor entity Radius Bank) under the federal CARES Act are guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA). If PPP loan funds are used by the borrower for specific purposes as provided under the PPP, the loan may be fully or partially forgiven by the SBA and the Bank will receive funds directly from the SBA. If, however, the PPP borrower fails to qualify for loan forgiveness then we may end up holding these loans at unfavorable interest rates as compared to the interest rate that we otherwise would have applied. \n There was and continues to be uncertainty regarding some of the laws, rules and guidance relating to the PPP. If the SBA or other regulators determine that the Bank has not complied with all PPP laws, rules and guidance, we could be required to refund some or all of the fees related to PPP loans that we have earned or be subject to other regulatory enforcement action. Furthermore, in the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded or serviced by the Bank, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty or, if it has already made payment under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the Bank. PPP lenders, including the Bank, may also be subject to the risk of litigation in connection with other aspects of the PPP, including but not limited to borrowers seeking forgiveness of their loans. Any financial liability or litigation related to the Bank’s participation in PPP could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n Our business may be adversely affected if our risk management framework does not effectively identify, assess and mitigate risk. \n Our risk management framework seeks to appropriately balance risk and return and mitigate our risks. We have established policies intended to regularly identify and assess our risk profile, including credit risk, pricing risk, liquidity risk, strategic risk and operational risk, and then implement appropriate processes and controls to mitigate the risk. \n If our risk management framework does not effectively identify, assess and/or mitigate our risk profile, we could suffer unexpected losses or be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, assessment of our risk profile depends, in part, upon the use of forecasting models. If these models are ineffective at predicting future losses or are otherwise inadequate, we may incur unexpected losses or otherwise be adversely affected. In addition, the information we use may be inaccurate or incomplete, both of which may be difficult to detect and avoid. Additionally, there may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated. \n Finally, our risk management framework may be deemed insufficient or inadequate by our regulators, which may require that we invest additional resources into remediating any deficiencies and adversely impact our ability to operate our business until such time as the revised framework is deemed sufficient and adequate by our regulators. \n Participation by non-U.S. residents on our marketplace bank may result in non-compliance with foreign laws. \n From time to time, non-U.S. residents invest in loans directly through our marketplace bank. We are not experts with respect to all applicable laws in the various foreign jurisdictions from which an investor may be located, and we cannot be sure that we are complying with all applicable foreign laws. Failure to comply with such laws could result in fines and penalties payable by us, which could reduce our profitability or cause us to modify or delay planned expansions and expenditures, including investments in our growth. In addition, any such fines and penalties could create negative publicity, result in additional regulatory oversight that could limit our operations and ability to succeed, or otherwise hinder our plans to expand our business internationally. \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n RISKS RELATED TO OPERATING OUR BUSINESS \n Our acquisitions and other strategic transactions, including our recent acquisition of Radius Bancorp, may not yield the intended benefits. \n We have historically and may continue to evaluate and consider strategic transactions, combinations, acquisitions, dispositions or alliances. These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations if consummated. If we are able to identify an appropriate business opportunity, we may not be successful in negotiating favorable terms and/or consummating the transaction and, even if we do consummate such a transaction, we may be unable to obtain the benefits or avoid the difficulties and risks of such transaction. \n In particular, on February 1, 2021, we acquired Radius Bancorp, Inc. (Radius) and thereby its wholly-owned subsidiary, Radius Bank. The Company anticipates that this acquisition may be transformational for the Company from both a financial and strategic perspective. However, any acquisition (including our acquisition of Radius), disposition or other strategic transactions involves risks, including: \n • difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations, personnel, systems, data, technologies, products and services of the acquired business, which may require ongoing investment in development and enhancement of additional operational and reporting processes and controls; \n • inability of the acquired technologies, products or businesses to achieve expected levels of revenue, profitability, productivity or other benefits; \n • difficulties in retaining, training, motivating and integrating key personnel; \n • diversion of management’s time and resources from our normal daily operations; \n • difficulties in successfully incorporating licensed or acquired technology and rights into our platform; \n • difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies within the combined organizations; \n • difficulties in retaining relationships with customers, employees and suppliers of the acquired business; \n • risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience; \n • regulatory risks, including remaining in good standing with existing regulatory bodies or receiving any necessary pre-closing or post-closing approvals, as well as being subject to new regulators with oversight over an acquired business; \n • assumption of contractual obligations that contain terms that are not beneficial to us, require us to license or waive intellectual property rights or increase our risk for liability; \n • failure to successfully further develop the acquired technology; \n • liability for activities of the acquired or disposed of business before the acquisition or disposition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, regulatory actions, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; \n • difficulty in separating assets and replacing shared services; \n • assumption of exposure to performance of any acquired loan portfolios; \n • potential disruptions to our ongoing businesses; and \n • unexpected costs and unknown risks and liabilities associated with the acquisition. \n Accordingly, any acquisition, disposition or other strategic transaction may not be successful, may not benefit our business strategy, may not generate sufficient revenue to offset the associated costs or may not otherwise result in the intended benefits. Additionally, it may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of these transactions (including the acquisition of Radius), and those benefits and synergies may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. \n The acquisition of Radius represents a significant transformation for the Company. While the Company is optimistic in its ability to integrate the Radius business and the strategic and financial opportunities the acquisition will enable, there is significant risk in the execution of the transformation and integration. For example, the Company is now subject to extensive regulation by the federal banking regulators and accordingly the Company needs to rapidly \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n evolve its compliance programs and ensure it has adequate processes and staffing to satisfy the applicable regulations and our regulators. Similarly in connection with the acquisition, the Company now offers a broader suite of products and services and there is a risk that there will be interruptions in the operation and support of these products and services while the Company completes the integration of the Radius business and personnel. Any failure, delay or interruptions related to this transformation and integration could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Finally, while the Company is undergoing this transformation and integration, certain of the other risks described in “ Item 1A. Risk Factors ” and elsewhere in our Report, such as our attrition risk, compliance with the bank regulatory regime, and resolution of regulatory and compliance matters associated with our prior regulatory regime, may be heightened during this inflection point for the Company. Further, the Company is transitioning from an issuing bank partnership model to one in which it directly originates the vast majority of its loans. \n Any transactions, combinations, acquisitions, dispositions or alliances may also require us to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt (and increased interest expense), liabilities, and amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill, which could adversely affect our results of operations and dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders and the interests of holders of our indebtedness. \n In addition, we cannot assure you that any acquisition of new businesses or technology will lead to the successful development of new or enhanced products and services or that any new or enhanced products and services, if developed, will achieve market acceptance or prove to be profitable. \n Finally, we may also choose to divest certain businesses or product lines that no longer fit with our strategic objectives. If we decide to sell assets or a business, we may have difficulty obtaining terms acceptable to us in a timely manner, or at all. Additionally, the terms of such potential transactions may expose the Company to ongoing obligations and liabilities. \n We are regularly subject to litigation, and government and regulatory investigations, inquiries and requests. \n We are regularly subject to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, lawsuits alleging regulatory violations such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices (UDAP) or Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts or Practices (UDAAP) violations, government and regulatory exams, investigations, inquiries or requests, and other proceedings involving consumer protection, privacy, labor and employment, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, cyber security, securities, tax, commercial disputes, record retention and other matters. The number and significance of these claims, lawsuits, exams, investigations, inquiries and requests have increased as our business has expanded in scope and geographic reach, and our products and services have increased in complexity. We are also subject to significant litigation and regulatory inquiries, as discussed more fully in “ Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies, ” below. In particular, note that on April 25, 2018, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a complaint in the Northern District of California ( FTC v. LendingClub Corporation , No. 3:18-cv-02454) alleging causes of action for violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, as amended, including claims of deception in connection with disclosures related to the origination fee associated with loans available through the Company’s platform, and in connection with communications relating to the likelihood of loan approval during the application process, and a claim of unfairness relating to certain unauthorized charges to borrowers’ bank accounts. The FTC’s complaint also alleged a violation of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act regarding the Company’s practices in delivering its privacy notice. \n The scope, timing, outcome, consequences and impact of claims, lawsuits, proceedings, investigations, inquiries and requests that we are subject to cannot be predicted with certainty. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment. Furthermore, resolution of such claims, lawsuits, proceedings, investigations, inquiries and requests could result in substantial fines, penalties or other monetary, injunctive or declaratory relief, which may materially and adversely affect our business. These claims, lawsuits, proceedings, exams, investigations, inquiries and requests could also: (i) result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products or \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n services, (ii) limit the Company’s access to credit, (iii) result in a modification or suspension of our business practices, (iv) require us to develop non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, (v) prompt ancillary claims, lawsuits, proceedings, investigations, inquiries and requests, (vi) consume financial and other resources which may otherwise be utilized for other purposes, such as advancing the Company’s products and services, (vii) cause a breach or cancellation of certain contracts, or (viii) result in a loss of customers, investors and/or ecosystem partners, any of which may adversely affect our business and operations. Furthermore, even following the resolution of any claims, lawsuits, proceedings, exams, investigations, inquiries and requests against the Company, a regulatory enforcement agency could take action against one or more individuals or entities, which may require us to continue to incur significant expense for indemnification for any such individual or entity until such matters may be resolved. Any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our business. \n Holding loans on our balance sheet exposes us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risk, which may adversely affect our financial performance. \n We may hold loans purchased by the Company or issued by the Bank for a short period or for a longer term. While these loans are on our balance sheet we earn interest on the loans, but we have exposure to the credit risk of the borrowers. In the event of a decline or volatility in the credit profile of these borrowers the value of these held loans may decline. This may adversely impact the liquidity of these loans, which could produce losses if the Company is unable to realize their fair value or manage declines in their value, each of which may adversely affect our financial performance. Further, utilizing our balance sheet to purchase loans at greater than forecasted amounts may impair our ability to allocate sufficient financial resources for other purposes, such as advancing the Company’s products and services, which could impact our results of operations. \n From time to time, we may provide incentives to investors to purchase such loans from the Company or we may sell the loans at a price that is less than par. Any incentive or difference to par may be partially or wholly offset by other factors, such as interest earned on the loan prior to its sale. However, selling loans with incentives or at prices less than par may discourage investors from purchasing loans on our platform without incentives or at par value, cause the Company to realize less revenue than expected with respect to such loans or prompt dissatisfaction and complaints from investors unable to purchase incentivized or discounted loans, each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results. \n If we are unable to develop and commercialize new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services, our business may suffer. \n The financial services and banking industry is evolving rapidly and changing with disruptive technologies and the introduction of new products and services. We derive a significant portion of our revenue from transaction-based fees we collect in connection with facilitating the origination of unsecured personal loans. To enhance customer engagement and diversify our revenue streams, we are undertaking a strategy to broaden the scope of our products and services we offer. Failure to broaden the scope of our products and services leaves us dependent on a single revenue stream and vulnerable to competitors offering a suite of products and services. Accordingly, a key part of our success depends on our ability to develop and commercialize new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services. \n We incur expenses and expend resources to develop and commercialize new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services. However, we may not assign the appropriate level of resources, priority or expertise to the development and commercialization of these new products, services or enhancements. We also could utilize and invest in technologies, products and services that ultimately do not achieve widespread adoption and, therefore, are not as attractive or useful to our customers as we anticipate. Moreover, we may not realize the benefit of new technologies, products, services or enhancements for many years, and competitors may introduce more compelling products, services or enhancements in the meantime. Competitors also may develop or adopt technologies or introduce innovations that make our marketplace bank platform less attractive to our borrowers and/or investors. \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n If we are unable to develop and commercialize timely and attractive products and services, our growth may be limited and our business may be materially and adversely affected. \n We may not be able to maintain our deposit base. \n Following the acquisition of Radius, we intend to rely on deposits as a principal source of funding for our lending activities. Upon the closing of the acquisition, we had approximately $2.0 billion in deposits. Our future growth and strategy will largely depend on our ability to maintain core deposits to provide a less costly and stable source of funding. The deposit markets are competitive, and therefore it may prove difficult to grow our core deposit base. Changes we make to the rates offered on our deposit products may affect our finances and liquidity. In addition, our ability to maintain existing or obtain additional deposits may be impacted by factors, including factors beyond our control, including perceptions about our reputation, financial strength or branchless banking generally, which could reduce the number of consumers choosing to place deposits with us. \n Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on capital levels of our bank subsidiary and being considered “well-capitalized” by the banking regulators. Our regulators can adjust the requirements to be “well-capitalized” at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses, including the interest rate we pay on deposits. An inability to develop and maintain a strong deposit base could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n An inability to maintain adequate liquidity could jeopardize our business and financial condition. \n Liquidity is essential to our business. Although we believe that we currently have an adequate amount of liquidity to support our business, there are a number of factors that could reduce and/or deplete our existing liquidity position, including results of operations that are reduced relative to our projections, costs related to existing or future litigation or regulatory matters, the pursuit of strategic business opportunities (whether through acquisition or organic) and unanticipated liabilities. Additionally, as noted above, we are subject stringent capital and liquidity regulations and requirements and need to manage our liquidity position at both LendingClub Corporation and the Bank within the parameters and terms set forth by applicable regulations and regulators. Any inability to maintain an adequate liquidity position could adversely affect our operations, our compliance with applicable regulations and the performance of our business. \n Further, our ability to raise additional capital, should that be deemed beneficial and/or necessary, depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the financial services and banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we may be unable to raise additional capital if needed or on acceptable terms, which may adversely affect our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations. \n If we are unable to offer platform investors a satisfactory breadth and volume of investment opportunities, our business and results of operations may be materially harmed. \n We invest in our marketplace bank platform and regularly iterate our processes to provide improved and more efficient investment opportunities, which includes efforts to provide platform investors the opportunity to invest in a broad selection of loans. However, various factors may contribute to certain loans being available only in a limited quantity or being entirely unavailable. \n Some of our agreements with platform investors contain provisions regarding the manner in which our marketplace bank platform product operates that could constrain the manner in which our marketplace bank platform product can develop, particularly with respect to how loans are selected for investment. These agreements could constrain the development of our marketplace bank, including efforts to offer a breadth of investment opportunities for and among a variety of investors, and/or result in significant damages that could impact our results in a given period. \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n If platform investors are unable to invest in certain categories of loans, are unable to invest at the volume they desire, perceive that they are not offered the same investment opportunities as other investors and/or are dissatisfied with the risk-adjusted return they receive from investing on our platform, they may seek alternative investments from ours which may materially harm our business and results of operations. \n Fraudulent activity associated with our marketplace bank could negatively impact our operating results, brand and reputation and cause the use of our products and services to decrease and our fraud losses to increase. \n We are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with our marketplace bank, borrowers, investors and third parties handling borrower and investor information. We have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be effective against new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new product offerings. Under our agreements with investors, we are obligated to repurchase loans in cases of confirmed identity theft. The level of our fraud charge-offs and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if fraudulent activity were to significantly increase. High profile fraudulent activity or significant increases in fraudulent activity could lead to regulatory intervention, negatively impact our operating results, brand and reputation and lead us to take steps to reduce fraud risk, which could increase our costs. \n In addition, in the past, third parties have attempted to defraud individuals, some of whom may be potential customers of ours, by misappropriating our logos and represented themselves as LendingClub in e-mail campaigns to e-mail addresses that have been obtained outside of LendingClub. In one particular scheme, third parties represented to individuals that they might obtain a loan if they paid an “advance fee.” Individuals who believe that the campaigns are genuine may make payments to these unaffiliated third parties. Although we take commercially reasonable steps to prevent third-party fraud, we cannot always be successful in preventing individuals from suffering losses as a result of these schemes. Individuals who suffer damages due to the actions of these unaffiliated third parties may negatively view LendingClub, causing damage to our brand and reputation and reducing our business. \n If we are unable to accurately forecast demand for loans, our business could be harmed. \n We operate a marketplace bank for consumer credit, balancing borrower demand for loans against investor demand for risk-adjusted returns. We offer credit to borrowers across a range of credit profiles and rates and we offer investment opportunities across a range of risk-adjusted returns. In the event that borrower demand at a given credit rate exceeds investor demand for that product for a given period, we may fund the loans and hold them on our balance sheet, which carries certain risks. The vast majority of investor funding on our platform is non-committed and therefore it is challenging to precisely forecast investor demand. In addition to the discussion in this section, see “ Holding loans on our balance sheet exposes us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risk, which may adversely affect our financial performance. ” \n Alternatively, in the event that investor demand at a given return exceeds borrower demand for that product for a given period, there may be insufficient inventory to satisfy investor demand. If investors do not believe their demand can be met on our platform, they may seek alternative investments from ours and our business may suffer. \n If we do not maintain or continue to increase loan originations through our marketplace bank, or expand our marketplace bank to new markets, we may not succeed in maintaining and/or growing our business, and as a result our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. \n To maintain and continue to grow our business, we must continue to increase loan originations through our marketplace bank by attracting a large number of new borrowers who meet our platform’s lending standards and new and existing investors to invest in these loans. Our ability to attract qualified borrowers and attract new and retain existing investors each depends in large part on the success of our marketing efforts, our visibility, placement and customer reviews on third-party platforms, and the competitive advantage of our products, particularly as we continue to grow our marketplace bank and introduce new products. If any of our marketing channels become less \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n effective, or the cost of these channels were to significantly increase, we may not be able to attract new and retain existing customers in a cost-effective manner or convert potential customers into active customers in our marketplace bank. Additionally, changes in the way third-party platforms operate, including changes in our participation on such platforms, could make the maintenance and promotion of our products and services, and thereby maintaining and growing loan originations, more expensive or more difficult. If loan originations through our platform stagnate or decrease, for any reason, our business and financial results may be adversely affected. \n If investors on our marketplace bank pause or cease their participation or exert influence over us, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. \n Our success depends in significant part on the financial strength of investors participating on our marketplace bank. Investors could, for any reason, experience financial difficulties and cease participating on our marketplace bank or fail to pay fees when due. Further, the financial returns on loans we offer on our platform may prove to be unsatisfactory to certain platform investors and, therefore, such investors may choose to deploy their capital elsewhere. The occurrence of one or more of these events with a significant number of investors could, alone or in combination, have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. \n Additionally, investors may exert significant influence over us, our management and operations. For example, if investors pause or discontinue their investment activity, we may need to provide incentives or discounts and/or enter into unique structures or terms to attract investor capital to the platform. These arrangements may have a number of different structures and terms, including alternative fee arrangements or other incentives. There is also no assurance that we will be able to enter into any of these transactions if necessary, or if we do, what the final terms will be. Failure to attract investor capital on reasonable terms may result in a reduction in origination volume. For example, a number of our largest platform investors ceased or significantly reduced their purchases of our products in the Spring of 2020, which resulted in a material reduction in our origination volume and revenue. Such actions may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n Any significant disruption in service on our platform or in our technology systems, including events beyond our control, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. \n We believe the technology platform that powers our marketplace bank enables us to deliver solutions to customers and provides a significant time and cost advantage over traditional banks. The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our technology and our underlying network infrastructure are critical to our operations, customer service and reputation. Our failure to maintain satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our technology and our underlying network infrastructure may impair our ability to attract new and retain existing customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. \n Any interruptions or delays in our technology systems or service, whether as a result of third-party error, our error, natural disasters, terrorism, other man-made problems, or security breaches, whether accidental or willful, could harm our relationships with our customers and our reputation. Additionally, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. Our disaster recovery plan has not been tested under actual disaster conditions, and we may not have sufficient capacity to recover all data and services in the event of an outage. These factors could prevent us from processing or posting payments on the loans, damage our brand and reputation, divert our employees’ attention, reduce our revenue, subject us to liability and cause customers to abandon our marketplace bank, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n Failure to maintain, protect and promote our brand may harm our business. \n Maintaining, protecting and promoting our brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our products and services and expanding our base of customers. Maintaining, protecting and promoting our brand depends on many factors, including our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, secure and innovative products and services, as well as our ability to maintain trust. \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n Our brand can be harmed in many ways, including failure by us or our partners to satisfy expectations of service and quality, inadequate protection of sensitive information, failure to maintain or provide adequate or accurate documentation and/or disclosures, compliance failures, failure to comply with contractual obligations, regulatory requests, inquiries or proceedings, litigation and other claims, employee misconduct and misconduct by our partners. We have also been, and may in the future be, the target of incomplete, inaccurate and/or misleading statements about our company, our business, and/or our products and services. Furthermore, our ability to maintain, protect and promote our brand is partially dependent on visibility and customer reviews on third-party platforms. Changes in the way these platforms operate could make the maintenance, protection and promotion of our products and services and our brand more expensive or more difficult. If we do not successfully maintain, protect and promote our brand we may be unable to maintain and/or expand our base of customers, which may materially harm our business. \n Any challenge to or adverse consequence from our use of the issuing bank partnership model may harm our business. \n We believe that our use of the issuing bank partnership model is appropriate for all the jurisdictions in which we operate and we have worked with federal, state and local regulatory agencies to help them understand the model. However, we operate in a complex and evolving regulatory environment at the federal and state level and some enforcement authorities and private parties have challenged the ability to rely on legislative and judicial authority that permits an FDIC-insured depository institution to "export" interest rates permitted by the laws of the state where the bank is located, regardless of the usury limitations imposed by the laws of the state of the borrower’s residence. \n Specifically, in May 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued its decision in Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC that interpreted the scope of federal preemption under the National Bank Act (NBA) and held that a nonbank assignee of a loan originated by a national bank was not entitled to the benefits of federal preemption of claims of usury. The Second Circuit’s decision is binding on federal courts located in Connecticut, New York, and Vermont, but the decision could also be adopted by other courts. While we believe that our use of the issuing bank model is factually distinguishable from such case, the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC could create potential liability under state statutes such as usury and consumer protection statutes. \n Any challenge to or adverse consequence of our use of the issuing bank partnership model could adversely affect our business (including requiring that we alter our business model for certain of our products), financial condition and results of operations. \n If we breach representations or warranties that we made in our securitization, whole loan or CLUB Certificate transactions, or if either we suffer a direct or indirect loss in our retained interests in these transactions, our financial condition could be harmed. \n We have sponsored a number of sales of unsecured personal whole loans through asset-backed securitizations. In connection with these securitizations, as well as our whole loan and CLUB Certificate transactions, we make certain customary representations, warranties and covenants. If there is a breach of those representations and warranties that materially and adversely affects the value of the subject loans, then we will be required to either cure the breach, repurchase the affected loans from the purchasing entity, replace the affected loans with other loans or make a loss of value payment, as the case may be. Any losses that result could be material and have an adverse effect on our financial condition. \n In the event that we suffer losses on all or a portion of the interests in any securitization transaction that we have retained (whether to comply with applicable risk retention rules or otherwise), our financial condition could be harmed. We may enter into similar transactions in the future and those transactions are likely to entail similar and other substantial risks. \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n Indebtedness could adversely affect our business and financial results. \n In the past, we have had a significant amount of indebtedness. While our indebtedness has recently materially decreased, if our debt service obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, more of our cash flow from operations would need to be allocated to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for other purposes. Our indebtedness also could limit our ability to execute our strategic plan and withstand competitive pressures and could reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. \n Should we desire to obtain additional indebtedness we may require a guarantee by the Bank, where substantially all of our operations are being conducted. Any such guarantee would require approval of the banking regulators and there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such a guarantee. To extent that we are not able to obtain a guarantee from the Bank, it may be more difficult or expensive for us to borrow money. \n Our ability to make payments on our debt, to repay our existing indebtedness when due, and to fund our business and operations and significant planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to pay with available cash or generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, if we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as utilizing available capital, limiting the facilitation of additional loans, selling assets, selling equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy, prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business and/or adversely affect our business and financial results. We also may not be able to refinance our indebtedness or take such other actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. \n RISKS RELATED TO MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR OTHER EXTERNAL FACTORS \n Our business has been and will likely continue to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. \n The COVID-19 pandemic and the mitigation efforts by governments to attempt to control its spread, including the closure of non-essential businesses and shelter in place orders, resulted in an unprecedented reduction in economic activity and significant dislocation on consumers, businesses, capital markets and the broader economy. In particular, the impact of COVID-19 on the finances of our borrowers has been profound as many have been, and will likely continue to be, impacted by unemployment, reduced earnings and/or elevated economic disruption and insecurity. \n In response to the impact of COVID-19, the Company has undertaken a number of initiatives to support its borrowers, protect investor returns, and preserve capital and liquidity. For example, we have added customer support capacity and instituted new payment and hardship plans, adjusted our credit and underwriting processes and standards, and undertaken a number of measures that aim to balance the platform without further use of the Company’s balance sheet. We will continue to actively monitor the situation, assess possible implications to our business and take appropriate actions in an effort to mitigate the adverse consequences of COVID-19. However, there can be no assurances that the initiatives taken by the Company will be sufficient or successful. \n There are no comparable recent events to accurately predict the effect COVID-19 may have, and, as a result, its ultimate impact is highly uncertain and subject to change. As of the date of this Report, COVID-19 has had, and may continue to have, a number of adverse effects on our business and results of operations, including materially decreased demand for our products and negative pressure on overall platform returns, including as a result of increased credit risk of borrowers (including elevated delinquencies and charge-off rates) and the implementation of forbearance plans. \n Further, our compliance with measures to contain the spread of or otherwise related to COVID-19 has impacted our day-to-day operations and could disrupt our business and operations, as well as that of our key vendors and \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n counterparties, for an indefinite period of time. To keep our employees safe and secure, we have temporarily closed our physical work spaces, instituted additional paid leave policies and leveraged technology to enable remote working. The disruptions caused by COVID-19 may result in inefficiencies and delays in product development, marketing, operations and customer service efforts that we cannot fully mitigate. \n The extent to which COVID-19 will continue to negatively impact our business and results of operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including the duration of the pandemic, actions taken to treat or control the spread of COVID-19, future strains or mutations of COVID-19, any re-emergence of COVID-19 or related diseases, and the intermediate and longer-term impact on consumers, businesses and the broader economy. For example, COVID-19 raises the possibility of a prolonged global economic downturn, which could further affect the performance of and demand for our products and services and adversely impact our business and results of operations even after the pandemic is contained. \n The COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact, may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in “ Item 1A. Risk Factors ” and elsewhere in our Report, such as managing our liquidity, growing platform volume and our exposure to litigation, and government and regulatory investigations, inquiries and requests. \n Any one or a combination of the factors identified above could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n Fluctuations in interest rates could negatively affect transaction volume and our net interest income. \n We offer loan products with both fixed and variable interest rates, depending on the type of loan. If interest rates rise, potential borrowers could seek to defer taking new loans as they wait for interest rates to decrease and/or settle, and borrowers of variable rate loans may be subject to increased interest rates, which could increase default risk. If interest rates decrease after a loan is made, existing borrowers may prepay their loans to take advantage of the lower rates. Furthermore, investors would lose the opportunity to collect the higher interest rate payable on the corresponding loan and may delay or reduce future loan investments. \n Our net interest income is the interest we earn on loans and investments less the interest we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Our net interest margin is the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and our other sources of funding. Changes in interest rates will cause our net interest income and margin to increase or decrease. To the extent that we hold loans for sale on our balance sheet, we will be at risk to rising interest rates between origination and sale. In order to sell such loans, we may need to reduce the sale price in order to satisfy the yield expectations of our investors. Fluctuations in the interest rate environment may impact our net interest income and/or discourage investors and borrowers from participating in our marketplace bank and may reduce our loan originations, any which may adversely affect our business. \n Notwithstanding the above, we monitor interest rates and have certain avenues to manage our interest rate risk exposure, including changing the interest rate offered on deposits and the interest rate on our loan products. If our interest rate risk management strategies are not appropriately monitored or executed, these activities may not effectively mitigate our interest rate sensitivity or have the desired impact on our results of operations or financial condition. \n Our business and operating results could be adversely affected by the political environment and governmental fiscal and monetary policies. \n An unpredictable or volatile political environment in the United States, including any related social unrest, could negatively impact business and market conditions, economic growth, financial stability, and business, consumer, investor, and regulatory sentiments, any one or more of which in turn could cause our business and financial results to suffer. \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n Our business and financial results are also significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve Bank, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States in pursuit of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The Federal Reserve Bank and its policies influence the availability and demand for loans and deposits, the rates and other terms for loans and deposits, the conditions in equity, fixed-income, currency, and other markets, and the value of securities and other financial instruments. Additionally, tax and other fiscal policies, moreover, impact not only general economic and market conditions but also give rise to incentives or disincentives that affect how we and our customers prioritize objectives, deploy resources, and run households or operate businesses. Both the timing and the nature of any changes in monetary or fiscal policies, as well as their consequences for the economy and the markets in which we operate, are beyond our control and difficult to predict but could adversely affect our business and operating results. \n A decline in social and economic conditions may adversely affect our customers, which may negatively impact our business and results of operations. \n As a marketplace bank, we believe our customers are highly susceptible to uncertainties and negative trends in the markets driven by, among other factors, general social and economic conditions in the United States and abroad. Economic factors include interest rates, unemployment levels, the impact of a federal government shutdown, natural disasters, public health emergencies, pandemics, gasoline prices, adjustments in monthly payments, adjustable-rate mortgages and other debt payments, the rate of inflation, relative returns available from competing investment products and consumer perceptions of economic conditions. Social factors include changes in consumer confidence levels and changes in attitudes with respect to incurring debt and the stigma of personal bankruptcy. \n These social and economic factors may affect the ability or willingness of borrowers to make payments on their loans. Because we pass through collected borrower payments to investors or we make payments to investors ratably only to the extent we receive the borrower’s payments on the corresponding loan, if we do not receive payment(s) on the corresponding loan, the investor will not be entitled to the corresponding amount(s) or payment(s) under the terms of the investment or whole loan purchase agreement. In some circumstances, economic and/or social factors could lead to a borrower deciding to pre-pay his or her loan obligation. In the event of a prepayment, while the investor would receive the return of principal, interest would no longer accrue on the loan. Accordingly, the return for the investor would decline as compared to a loan that was timely paid in accordance with the amortization schedule. There is no penalty to borrowers if they choose to pay their loan early. \n We strive to establish a marketplace bank in which annual percentage rates are attractive to borrowers and returns, including the impact of credit losses and prepayments, are attractive to investors. These external economic and social conditions and resulting trends or uncertainties could also adversely impact our customers’ ability or desire to participate on our platform as borrowers or investors, which could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition to the discussion in this section, see “ Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview. ” \n Our business operations may be adversely impacted by political events, terrorism, cyber-attacks, public health issues, natural disasters, severe weather, climate change, infrastructure failure or outages, labor disputes and other business interruptions. \n Our business operations are subject to interruption by, among other things, political events, terrorism, cyber-attacks, public health issues, natural disasters, severe weather, climate change, infrastructure failure or outages, labor disputes and other events which could decrease demand for our products and services or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver a satisfactory experience to our customers. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their outstanding loans, cause significant property damage or otherwise impair the value of collateral securing our loans, and result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. Although we have established disaster recovery plans and procedures, and we monitor the effects of any such events on our loans, properties and investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n Furthermore, in the event of any disruption to our operations or those of the companies with whom we do business with, we could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume or maintain operations, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n Negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage could negatively affect our business. \n Negative publicity about our industry or our company, including with respect to the quality and reliability of our marketplace bank, effectiveness of the credit decisioning or scoring models used in the marketplace bank, the effectiveness of our collection efforts, statements regarding investment returns, changes to our marketplace bank, our ability to grow our borrower and investor base at a rate expected by the market, our ability to effectively manage and resolve borrower and investor complaints, our ability to manage borrower and investor accounts in compliance with regulatory requirements which may not be clear, privacy and security practices, use of loan proceeds by certain borrowers of ours or other companies in our industry for illegal purposes, litigation, regulatory activity and the experience of borrowers and investors with our marketplace bank or services, even if inaccurate, could adversely affect our reputation and the confidence in, and the use of, our marketplace bank, which could harm our business and operating results. Harm to our reputation can arise from many sources, including employee misconduct, misconduct by our partners or partners of partners, other online marketplace banks, outsourced service providers or other counterparties, failure by us or our partners to meet minimum standards of service and quality, inadequate protection of borrower and investor information and compliance failures and claims. \n RISKS RELATED TO CREDIT AND COLLECTIONS \n If the credit decisioning, pricing, loss forecasting and scoring models we use contain errors, do not adequately assess risk, or are otherwise ineffective, our reputation and relationships with customers could be harmed, our market share could decline and the value of loans held on our balance sheet may be adversely affected. \n Our ability to attract customers to, and build trust in, our marketplace bank is significantly dependent on our ability to effectively evaluate a borrower’s credit profile and likelihood of default. To conduct this evaluation, we utilize credit decisioning, pricing, loss forecasting and scoring models that assign each loan offered on our marketplace bank a grade and a corresponding interest rate. Our models are based on algorithms that evaluate a number of factors, including behavioral data, transactional data, bank data and employment information, which may not effectively predict future loan losses. If we are unable to effectively segment borrowers into relative risk profiles, we may be unable to offer attractive interest rates for borrowers and risk-adjusted returns for investors. Additionally, if these models fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers, we may experience higher than forecasted losses. Furthermore, as stated above, we hold loans on our balance sheet. We periodically assess the value of these loans and in doing so we review and incorporate a number of factors including forecasted losses. Accordingly, if we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers such that we experience higher than forecasted losses, the value of the loans held our balance sheet may be adversely affected. \n We continually refine these algorithms based on new data and changing macro-economic conditions. However, there is no guarantee that the credit decisioning, pricing, loss forecasting and scoring models that we use have accurately assessed the creditworthiness of our borrowers, or will be effective in assessing creditworthiness in the future. \n Similarly, if any of these models contain programming or other errors, are ineffective or the data provided by borrowers or third parties is incorrect or stale, our loan pricing and approval process could be negatively affected, resulting in mispriced or misclassified loans or incorrect approvals or denials of loans. If these errors were to occur, we may be obligated to repurchase the affected loans, investors may try to rescind their affected investments or decide not to invest in loans in the future or borrowers may seek to revise the terms of their loans or reduce the use of our marketplace bank for loans. \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n If collection efforts on delinquent loans are ineffective or unsuccessful, the return on investment for investors in those loans would be adversely affected and investors may not find investing through our marketplace bank desirable. \n Many of our loan products, including all of our personal loans, are unsecured obligations of borrowers, and they are not secured by any collateral. None of the loans facilitated on our platform are guaranteed or insured by any third party nor backed by any governmental authority in any way. We are the loan servicer for all loans supporting notes, all certificates and certain secured borrowings, and we are the loan servicer for most, though not all, loans sold as whole loans. The ability to collect on the loans is dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and consequently, collections can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including job loss, divorce, death, illness, personal bankruptcy or the economic and/or social factors referenced above. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans. Accordingly, we and our designated third-party servicers and collection agencies are limited in our ability to collect loans. \n In addition, most investors must depend on LendingClub or our third-party servicers and collection agents to pursue collection on delinquent borrower loans. Because we make payments ratably on an investor’s investment only if we receive the borrower’s payments on the corresponding loan, if we, or third parties on our behalf, cannot adequately perform collection services, the investor will not be entitled to any payments under the terms of the investment. Further, if collection action must be taken in respect of a loan, we or the collection agency may charge a collection fee on any amounts that are obtained (excluding litigation). These fees will correspondingly reduce the amounts of any payments received by an investor. Similarly, the returns to investors may be impacted by declines in market rates for sales of charged-off loans to third party purchasers. Ultimately, if delinquencies impair our ability to offer attractive risk-adjusted returns for investors, they may seek alternative investments from ours and our business may suffer. \n In addition, because our servicing fees depend on the collectability of the loans, if we experience a significant increase in the number of delinquent or charged-off loans we will be unable to collect our entire servicing fee for such loans and our revenue could be adversely affected. \n Credit and other information that we receive from borrowers or third parties about a borrower may be inaccurate or may not accurately reflect the borrower’s creditworthiness, which may cause us to inaccurately price loans made by our marketplace bank. \n Our ability to review and select qualified borrowers depends on obtaining borrower credit information from consumer reporting agencies, such as TransUnion, Experian or Equifax, and other third parties and we assign loan grades to loan requests based on our marketplace bank’s credit decisioning and scoring models that take into account reported credit score, other information reported by the consumer reporting agencies and the requested loan amount, in addition to a variety of other factors. A credit score or loan grade assigned to a borrower may not reflect that borrower’s actual creditworthiness because the credit score may be based on outdated, incomplete or inaccurate consumer reporting data, and we do not verify the information obtained from the borrower’s credit report. \n Additionally, there is a risk that, following the date of the credit report or other third-party data that we obtain and review, a borrower may have: \n • become delinquent in the payment of an outstanding obligation; \n • defaulted on a pre-existing debt obligation; \n • taken on additional debt; or \n • sustained other adverse financial events. \n In addition, borrowers supply a variety of information that is included in the loan listings on our marketplace bank, and it may be inaccurate or incomplete. To verify a borrower’s identity, income or employment, our verification process and teams connect to various data sources, directly or through third-party service providers, contact the \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n human resources department of the borrower’s stated employer, or request pay stubs. However, we often do not verify a borrower’s stated tenure, job title, home ownership status or intention for the use of loan proceeds. \n The factors above may result in loans being issued to otherwise non-qualified borrowers and/or impact our ability to effectively segment borrowers into relative risk profiles, each of which may impair our ability to offer attractive risk-adjusted returns for investors, which may cause investors to seek alternative investments from ours and our business may suffer. Additionally, if borrowers default on loans that are not priced correctly because the information provided by the borrowers or third parties is inaccurate, investors may try to rescind their affected investments in these loans or the loans may not perform as expected and our reputation may be harmed. \n RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY \n Substantial and increasing competition in our industry may harm our business. \n The financial services and banking industry is increasingly competitive. We compete with financial products and companies that attract borrowers, investors or both, as described in “ Item 1. Business – Competition. ” \n Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and may have access to less expensive capital than we do, and may offer a broader range of products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower operating or financing costs, or have different profitability expectations than us. Certain competitors may be able to offer lower rates to borrowers than we are able to offer and/or structure their products in a manner that is more attractive to potential customers. Additionally, some of our competitors may also be subject to less burdensome licensing and other regulatory requirements. \n If we do not offer, price and develop attractive products and services for our customers, we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors and our business and results of operations may be materially harmed. \n We could be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions. \n Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when our collateral cannot be foreclosed upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due. Any such losses could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n RISKS RELATED TO PERSONNEL AND THIRD-PARTIES \n If we fail to attract and retain our highly skilled employees needed to support our business, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer. \n We believe our success depends on the efforts and talents of our employees, including software engineers, financial, banking, credit and risk personnel and marketing professionals. Our future success depends on our continued ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Competition for highly skilled technical and financial personnel, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, is extremely intense. Building and maintaining a positive culture and work environment that reinforces the Company’s values is also critical to attracting and retaining employees. \n We have had a high attrition rate from employees and expect our attrition rate to remain elevated. We may not be able to hire and retain these personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced employees have greater resources than we have and may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment. Additionally, changes in U.S. immigration \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n policy may make it difficult to renew or obtain visas for certain highly skilled employees that we have hired or are recruiting. \n In addition to attracting and retaining highly skilled employees in general, our future performance depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel, including our executive officers, the personnel we onboarded as a result of our acquisition of Radius, senior management team and other key personnel, all of whom would be difficult to replace. The loss of the services of our executive officers or members of our senior management team, and the process to replace any of them, would involve significant time and expense and distraction that may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives or impair our operations or results. \n Misconduct and errors by our employees, contractors and third-party service providers could harm our business and reputation. \n We are exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of misconduct and errors by our employees and other third-party service providers. Our business depends on our employees, contractors and third-party service providers to facilitate the operation of our business and process a large number of increasingly complex transactions, and if any of our employees, contractors or third-party service providers provide unsatisfactory service or take, convert or misuse funds, documents or data (including customer and/or internal documents or data), or fail to follow protocol when interacting with customers, we could lose customers, harm our reputation, be liable for damages, be subject to repurchase obligations and be subject to complaints, regulatory actions and penalties. \n While we have internal procedures and oversight functions to protect the Company against these risks, we could also be perceived to have facilitated or participated in the illegal misappropriation of funds, documents or data, or the failure to follow protocol, and therefore be subject to civil or criminal liability. \n Additionally, our use of third party vendors is subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by our regulators. Regulations require us to perform due diligence, ongoing monitoring and control over our third party vendors and other ongoing third party business relationships. We expect that our regulators will hold us responsible for deficiencies in our oversight and control of our third-party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which we have these relationships. \n Any of these occurrences could result in our diminished ability to operate our business, potential liability to customers, inability to attract future customers, reputational damage, regulatory intervention, enforcement action and financial harm, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n Our growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties. \n In order to grow our business and effectuate our product to platform strategy, we anticipate that we will depend in part on our ability to develop and expand our strategic relationship with third parties to offer additional products and services on our platform. \n Identifying suitable partners, and negotiating and documenting relationships with them, requires significant time and resources. In some cases, we also compete directly with our partners’ product offerings, and if these partners cease their strategic relationship with us it could result in fewer product and service offerings on our platform, which may impede our ability to execute on our product to platform strategy. Further, if we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties, or realizing the anticipated benefits from such partnerships, our ability to compete and to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results may suffer. \n A disruption or failure in services provided by third parties could materially and adversely affect our business. \n We increasingly rely on third parties to provide and/or assist with certain critical aspects of our business, including: (i) customer support, (ii) collections, (iii) loan origination, (iv) data verification and (v) cloud computing. These third parties may be subject to cybersecurity incidents, privacy breaches, service disruptions and/or financial, legal, \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n regulatory, labor or operational issues; any of which may result in the third party providing inadequate service levels to us or our customers. In addition, these third parties may breach their agreements with us and/or refuse to continue or renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms. If any third party provides inadequate service levels or fails to provide services at all, we may face business disruptions, customer dissatisfaction, reputational damage and/or financial and legal exposure; any of which may harm our business. \n RISKS RELATED TO DATA, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PRIVACY \n Security incidents, system failures, bugs in our system, and similar disruptions could impair our operations, compromise the confidential information of our borrowers and our investors, damage our reputation, and harm our business and financial performance. \n We believe the technology platform that powers our marketplace bank enables us to deliver solutions to customers and provides a significant time and cost advantage over traditional banks. The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our technology and our underlying network infrastructure are critical to our operations, customer service and reputation. Like all information systems and technology, our systems may contain or develop material errors, failures, vulnerabilities or bugs, particularly when new features or capabilities are released, and may be subject to computer viruses or other malicious code, break-ins, phishing impersonation attacks, attempts to overload our servers with denial-of-service or other attacks, ransomware and similar incidents or disruptions from unauthorized use of our computer systems, as well as unintentional incidents causing data leakage, any of which could lead to interruptions, delays or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver a satisfactory experience to our customers. Our failure to maintain satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our technology and our underlying network infrastructure may impair our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n Our business involves the collection, storage, processing and transmission of customers’ personal information, including financial information of customers. The highly automated nature of our marketplace bank, our reliance on digital technologies and the types and amount of data collected, stored and processed on our systems make us an attractive target and subject to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. While we have taken steps to protect confidential information that we collect, create, or have access to, our security measures or those of our third-party vendors and business partners are subject to breach. Unauthorized access to our proprietary business information or customer data may be obtained through, among other things, break-ins, sabotage, computer malware, viruses, social engineering, ransomware attacks, hacking into the systems or facilities of us or our partners, vendors, or customers, exposing and exploiting design flaws in our software, or other misconduct, including by state-sponsored and other sophisticated organizations. Such incidents have become more prevalent in recent years. For example, outside parties have attempted to fraudulently induce employees, vendors, customers, or others to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to our systems. Our security measures could also be compromised by our personnel, theft, or errors, or be insufficient to prevent exploitation of security vulnerabilities in software or systems on which we rely. \n Cyber-attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future. Although to date the Company has not suffered material costs or disruption to our business caused by any such incident, unauthorized access to our marketplace bank and servicing systems can result in confidential borrower and investor information being stolen and potentially used for criminal purposes. Breaches of our security measures could negatively impact our relationships with customers and expose us to liability related to the loss of the information, time-consuming expensive litigation and negative publicity. Moreover, any future security breach may also result in the theft of our intellectual property, proprietary data, or trade secrets, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business operations and financial performance. \n We also may be required to notify regulators and affected individuals about any actual or perceived data breach involving personal information within strict time periods. The notice may be difficult to provide in a timely fashion for many reasons, including due to the complexity of gathering, verifying and analyzing relevant information. Furthermore, these mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach are costly to implement and often lead to \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n widespread negative publicity, which may cause customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures. Any security breach, whether actual or perceived, would harm our reputation, we could lose borrowers, investors and ecosystem partners and our business and operations could be adversely affected. \n Because there are many different cybercrime and hacking techniques and such techniques continue to evolve, we may be unable to anticipate attempted security breaches, react in a timely manner or implement adequate preventative measures. Cyber-attacks may take advantage of weaknesses in third-party technology or standards of which we are unaware or that we do not control and may not be recognized until long after they have been launched against a target. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more difficult to detect. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our services or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop, implement, and maintain. Such efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated and may limit the functionality of, or otherwise adversely impact, our service offerings and systems. \n The systems we rely upon also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from a number of other factors, including the failure of our network or software systems, natural disasters, terrorism, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, human error, third-party error, other-man made problems, and similar events or disruptions. Any interruptions or delays in our technology systems or service, whether accidental or willful, could harm our relationships with our customers and our reputation. Additionally, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. Our disaster recovery plan has not been tested under actual disaster conditions, and we may not have sufficient capacity to recover all data and services in the event of an outage. These factors could prevent us from processing or posting payments on the loans, damage our brand and reputation, divert our employees’ attention, reduce our revenue, subject us to liability and cause customers to abandon our marketplace bank, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n Cyber-attacks suffered by third parties upon which we rely could negatively affect our business. \n We rely on third-party service providers to provide critical services that help us deliver our solutions and operate our business. These providers may store or otherwise process the same sensitive, proprietary, and confidential information that we handle. For example, in certain circumstances we utilize third-party vendors, including cloud applications and services, to facilitate the servicing of customer accounts. Under these arrangements, third-party vendors require access to certain customer data for the purpose of servicing the accounts. These service providers may not have adequate security measures and could experience a security incident that compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the systems they operate for us or the information they process on our behalf. Such occurrences could adversely affect our business to the same degree as if we had experienced these occurrences directly, and we may not have recourse to the responsible third-party service providers for the resulting liability we incur. \n We also utilize certain information provided by third parties to facilitate the marketing, distribution, servicing and collection of loans. A cyber-attack suffered by a third-party that provides data to us could impact our ability to market, distribute, service or collect for borrowers or investors. For example, Equifax announced a significant cyber breach that impacted millions of consumers. We utilize certain information from Equifax to allow us to market our products through pre-screened offers to qualified borrowers. If a consumer elects to “freeze” their credit data, we would not be able to access their information to make these pre-screened offers. Further, as a result of the release of personal information from a third-party platform, we could experience an increase in fraudulent loan applications or investor accounts. Under our policies, we reimburse investors for any loan obtained as a result of a verified identity fraud and any increase in identity theft could result in increased reimbursement costs. \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n The collection, processing, storage, use, and disclosure of personal information could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights. \n We receive, transmit, store and process a large volume of personal information and other user data. There are federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure, protection and other processing of personal information and other user data. Specifically, personal information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous U.S. and international jurisdictions, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. \n Governments, regulators, the plaintiffs’ bar, privacy advocates and customers have increased their focus on how companies collect, process, use , store, share and transmit personal information. This regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is evolving and is likely to continue to evolve for the foreseeable future, which creates uncertainty. For example, in June 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which became effective January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how certain personal information is used and shared. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches, which is expected to increase the volume, cost and success of class action data breach litigation. The CCPA excludes information covered by the GLBA, the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act, the FCRA, or the California Financial Information Privacy Act from the CCPA’s scope, but the CCPA’s definition of “personal information” is broad and may encompass other information that we maintain. The California Attorney General issued, and subsequently updated, proposed regulations to further define and clarify the CCPA. The full impact of this law and its corresponding regulations, future enforcement activity and potential liability is unknown. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., and multiple states have enacted or proposed similar laws. There is also discussion in Congress of new comprehensive federal data protection and privacy law to which we likely would be subject if it is enacted. \n In addition, California voters approved the November 2020 ballot measure which will enact the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which modifies the CCPA and has many provisions that will go into effect on January 1, 2023. Effective as of this year, the CPRA establishes the California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the CCPA and CPRA, as well as to impose administrative fines. \n We cannot yet predict the full impact of the CCPA, CPRA or proposed U.S. and international data privacy legislation on our business or operations, but such laws may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. We could also be adversely affected if other legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or privacy policies, or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any actual or perceived failure to comply with data privacy laws or regulations, or related contractual or other obligations, or any perceived privacy rights violation, could lead to investigations, claims, and proceedings by governmental entities and private parties, damages for contract breach, and other significant costs, penalties, and other liabilities, as well as harm to our reputation and market position. \n We post on our website our privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use, disclosure and processing of personal information. We also obtain consent from our borrowers to share personal information under certain conditions. We are subject to the terms of our privacy policies, privacy-related disclosures, and contractual and other privacy-related obligations to our customers and other third parties. Our failure, real or perceived, to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal, state or foreign laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personal information or other user data could damage our reputation, discourage potential borrowers or investors from using our marketplace bank or result in fines or proceedings brought against us, our issuing banks or other third parties by governmental agencies, borrowers, investors or other third parties, one or all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to laws, regulations and other applicable common law rules regarding privacy and privacy advocacy, industry groups or other private parties may propose new and different privacy standards. We could also \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n be subject to liability for the inappropriate use of information made available by us. Because the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws and privacy standards are still uncertain, it is possible that these laws or privacy standards may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations and privacy standards, could result in additional cost and liability for us, damage our reputation, inhibit use of our marketplace bank and harm our business. \n Any failure to protect our own intellectual property rights could impair our brand, or subject us to claims for alleged infringement by third parties, which could harm our business. \n We rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret, trademark, patent and other rights, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, underwriting and credit decisioning data, processes and other intellectual property. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our copyright, trade secret, trademark, patent and other rights or applications for any of the foregoing. Further, as our business continues to expand we may increase our dependence on third parties to provide additional products and services. Third parties who are contractually obligated to protect our intellectual property may be the target of data breaches or may breach their obligations and disseminate, misappropriate or otherwise misuse our proprietary technology, underwriting and data, processes and other intellectual property. Additionally, our competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our industry. From time to time, third parties may claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing on such rights. We may, however, be unaware of the intellectual property rights that others may claim cover some or all of our technology or services. \n In order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. In addition, any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our products or operating our platform or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could seriously adversely affect our brand and adversely impact our business. \n Some aspects of our platform include open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business. \n Aspects of our platform include software covered by open source licenses, which may include, by way of example, GNU General Public License and the Apache License. Open source license terms are often ambiguous, and there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of the terms of certain of these licenses. Therefore, the potential impact of such terms on our business is somewhat unknown. If portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release and grant royalty-free licenses under the affected portions of our proprietary source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our technologies, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our technologies and products. There can be no assurance that efforts we take to monitor the use of open source software to avoid uses in a manner that would require us to disclose or grant licenses under our proprietary source code will be successful, and such use could inadvertently occur. This could harm our intellectual property position and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Many of the risks associated with use of open source software cannot be eliminated, and could adversely affect our business. \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n RISKS RELATED TO TAX AND ACCOUNTING \n Our ability to use our deferred tax assets to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations that could subject our business to higher tax liabilities. \n We may be limited in the portion of net operating loss carryforwards that we can use in the future to offset taxable income for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) enacted on December 22, 2017, makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code. While future interpretative guidance of the Tax Act and how many U.S. states will incorporate these federal law changes may have an impact on our business, the Tax Act’s reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, has reduced our deferred tax asset associated with net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs). A lack of future taxable income would adversely affect our ability to utilize our NOLs. \n In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code), a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. Future changes in our stock ownership as well as other changes that may be outside of our control, could result in additional ownership changes under Section 382 of the Code. Our NOLs may also be impaired under similar provisions of state law. \n We assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets. On the basis of this evaluation, a full valuation allowance has historically been recorded to recognize only deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized. \n Finally, further changes to the federal or state tax laws or technical guidance relating to the Tax Act that would further reduce the corporate tax rate could operate to effectively reduce or eliminate the value of any deferred tax asset. Our tax attributes as of December 31, 2020 may expire unutilized or underutilized, which could prevent us from offsetting future taxable income. \n We have incurred net losses in the past and may incur net losses in the future. \n As of December 31, 2020, our accumulated deficit was $786.2 million. Our operating expenses may continue to be elevated as we resolve additional matters that arose from legacy management, settle regulatory investigations and examinations, enhance our compliance systems, reestablish the growth of our business, attract borrowers, investors and partners, integrate Radius Bank, and further enhance and develop our products and services. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. We may incur additional net losses in the future and may not maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. \n RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK \n Our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile. \n Our stock price has declined significantly since the end of the first quarter of 2016 and has exhibited substantial volatility. Our stock price may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as quarterly operating results; changes in our financial projections provided to the public or our failure to meet those projections; changes in the credit performance on our platform; the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC; progress and resolution with respect to existing litigation and regulatory inquiries; our acquisition of the Bank, significant transactions, or new features, products or services by us or our competitors; changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; media coverage of our business and financial performance; the operating and stock price performance of, or other developments involving, other companies that investors may deem comparable to us; trends in our industry; any significant change in our management; and general economic conditions. \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for companies in our industry, have experienced volatility. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our own stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. Volatility in our stock price also impacts the value of our equity compensation, which affects our ability to recruit and retain employees. In addition, some companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock, including us, have been subject to securities class action litigation. We have been the target of this type of litigation and may continue to be a target in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business. \n Further, our stock could be the target of short sellers who may seek to drive down the price of shares they have sold short by disseminating negative reports or information about the Company. Such negative publicity may lead to additional public scrutiny, may cause further volatility in our stock price, a decline in the value of a stockholder’s investment in us or reputational harm. \n Any stock price decline could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. \n Future issuances and/or sales of common stock may result in significant dilution to our stockholders and may place downward pressure on our stock price. \n We may issue additional equity securities to raise capital, support acquisitions, or for a variety of other purposes. We also utilize equity-based compensation as an important tool in recruiting and retaining employees and other service providers. Additional issuances of our stock may be made pursuant to the exercise or vesting of new or existing stock options or restricted stock units, respectively. Dilution to existing holders of our common stock from equity-based compensation and other additional issuances could be substantial and may place downward pressure on our stock price. \n Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the longer term underlying performance of our business. \n Our operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly. These fluctuations may be due to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results include our ability to attract and retain new customers, seasonality in our business, the costs associated with and outcomes of legal and regulatory matters, volatility related to fraud and credit performance, the timing of capital markets transactions, variability in the valuation of loans held on our balance sheet, changes in business or macroeconomic conditions and variety of other factors, including as a result of the risks set forth in this “Risk Factors” section. Fluctuation in quarterly results and how we perform relative to guidance may adversely affect the price of our common stock. \n Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company. \n Our restated Certificate of Incorporation and restated Bylaws contain provisions that can have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. The provisions, among other things: \n • establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time; \n • permit only our board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill vacancies on the board; \n • provide that directors may only be removed “for cause” and only with the approval of two-thirds of our stockholders; \n • require two-thirds vote to amend some provisions in our restated Certificate of Incorporation and restated Bylaws; \n LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION \n • authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a “poison pill”); \n • eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; \n • prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which will require that all stockholder actions must be taken at a stockholder meeting; \n • do not provide for cumulative voting; and \n • establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. \n These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management. In addition to these provisions, banking laws impose notice, approval, and ongoing regulatory requirements on any shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an FDIC-insured depository institution. These laws include the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act. These laws could delay or prevent an acquisition. See “ Item 1. Business – Regulation and Supervision – Acquisition of a Significant Interest in the Company ” for additional information. \n If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. \n Research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business may be consumed by equity investors and influence their opinion of our business and/or investment in our common stock. For example, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our stock, our stock price may decline. Additionally, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. \n We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. \n We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, an investor may only receive a return on their investment in our common stock if the trading price of our common stock increases. \n Also, as a bank holding company, our ability to pay dividends is affected by the policies and enforcement powers of the FRB and any future payment of dividends will depend on the Bank’s ability to make distributions and payments to the Company as our principal source of funds to pay such dividends. The Bank is also subject to various legal, regulatory and other restrictions on its ability to make distributions and payments to the Company. In addition, in the future, we may enter into borrowing or other contractual arrangements that restrict its ability to pay dividends. As a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, we may not be able to make the payment of dividends on our common stock. See “ Item 1. Business – Regulation and Supervision – Regulatory Limits on Dividends and Distributions” for additional information.
