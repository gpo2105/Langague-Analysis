The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report should be carefully considered.  The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business, results of operations or financial condition.  If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. \n Declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance. \n Our financial prospects are significantly dependent upon the sale of travel services, particularly leisure travel.  Travel, including hotel, rental car and airline ticket reservations, is dependent on discretionary spending levels. As a result, sales of travel services tend to decline during general economic downturns and recessions when consumers engage in less discretionary spending, are concerned about unemployment or inflation, have reduced access to credit or experience other concerns or effects that reduce their ability or willingness to travel.  Accordingly, the recent worldwide recession led to a weakening in the fundamental demand for our services and an increase in the number of customers who canceled existing travel reservations with us.  Further, many governments around the world, including the U.S. government and certain European governments, are operating at large financial deficits.  Disruptions in the economies of such countries could cause, contribute to or be indicative of deteriorating macro-economic conditions.  Failure to reach political consensus regarding workable solutions to these issues has resulted in a high level of uncertainty regarding the future economic outlook.  This uncertainty, as well as concern over governmental austerity measures including higher taxes and reduced government spending, could impair consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand.  Over recent quarters, we have experienced declines in transaction growth rates and weaker trends in hotel average daily rates (“ADRs”) across many regions of the world, particularly in those European countries that appear to be most affected by economic uncertainties.  We believe that these business trends are likely impacted by weak economic conditions and sovereign debt concerns.  The uncertainty of macro-economic factors and their impact on consumer behavior across regions, which may differ, makes it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trends and the timing and degree of their impact on our markets and business, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our business and adversely affect our results of operations. \n During the recent worldwide recession, the hotel industry experienced a significant decrease in occupancy rates and ADRs, and an increase in reservation cancellation rates.  While lower occupancy rates have historically resulted in hotel room providers increasing their distribution of hotel room reservations through third-party intermediaries such as us, our remuneration for hotel room reservation transactions changes proportionately with room price, and therefore, lower ADRs generally have a negative effect on our hotel room reservation business and a negative effect on our gross profit. \n In addition, other unforeseen events beyond our control, such as higher oil prices, terrorist attacks, unusual weather patterns, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, volcanic eruptions (such as the April 2010 eruption of a volcano in Iceland), travel related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics such as Influenza H1N1, avian bird flu and SARS, political instability, regional hostilities, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities or travel related accidents, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  Because these events are largely unpredictable, they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumers, and therefore demand for our services, which can adversely affect our results of operations.  For example, in late 2012 Hurricane Sandy disrupted travel in the northeastern United States.  In early 2011, Japan was struck by a major earthquake, tsunami and nuclear emergency.  In October 2011, severe flooding in Thailand, a key market for our Agoda.com business and the Asian business of Booking.com, negatively impacted booking volumes and cancellation rates in this market.  In addition, in early 2010, Thailand experienced disruptive civil unrest, which caused the temporary relocation of Agoda.com's Thailand-based operations.  Future natural disasters or civil or political unrest could further disrupt our business and operations. \n We face risk related to the growth rate and expansion of our international business. \n We derive a substantial portion of our revenues, and have significant operations, outside the United States. Our international operations include the Netherlands-based hotel reservation service Booking.com, the Asia-based hotel reservation service Agoda.com and the U.K.-based rental car reservation service rentalcars.com.  Our international operations have achieved significant year-over-year growth in their gross bookings (an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value, generally inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by our customers).  This growth rate, which has contributed significantly to our growth in consolidated revenue, gross profit and earnings per share, has declined, a trend we expect to continue as the absolute level of our gross bookings grows larger.  Other factors may also slow the growth rates of our revenues derived from our international business, including, for example, worldwide economic conditions, any strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Euro and other currencies, declines in ADRs, increases in cancellations, adverse \n changes in travel market conditions and the competitiveness of the market.  A decline in the growth rates of our international business could have a negative impact on our future gross profit and earnings per share growth rates and, as a consequence, our stock price. \n Our strategy involves continued rapid international expansion in regions throughout the world. Many of these regions have different customs, different currencies, different levels of customer acceptance of the Internet and different legislation, regulatory environments, tax laws and levels of political stability.  International markets may have strong local competitors with an established brand and travel service provider relationships that may make expansion in that market difficult and costly and take more time than anticipated.  In addition, compliance with foreign legal, regulatory or tax requirements places demands on our time and resources, and we may nonetheless experience unforeseen and potentially adverse legal, regulatory or tax consequences.  If we are unsuccessful in rapidly expanding in new and existing markets and managing that expansion, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected. \n Certain markets in which we operate that are in earlier stages of development have lower operating margins compared to more mature markets, which could have a negative impact on our overall margins as these markets increase in size over time.  Also, we intend to continue to invest in adding hotels and accommodations as participants in our services.  Many of the newer properties we add, especially in highly penetrated markets, may have fewer rooms, may have lower ADRs, may have higher credit risk and may appeal to a smaller subset of customers (for example, hostels and bed and breakfasts) and therefore may also negatively impact our margins. \n The number of our employees worldwide has grown from less than 700 in the first quarter of 2007, to approximately 7,000 as of December 31, 2012, which growth is mostly comprised of hires by our international operations, including as a result of our international acquisitions.  As a result of such rapid expansion, the average tenure of our employees has become shorter.  We may not be able to hire, train, retain, motivate and manage required personnel, which may limit our growth, damage our reputation, negatively affect our financial performance, and otherwise harm our business.  In addition, expansion increases the complexity of our business and places additional strain on our management, operations, technical performance, financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions.  Our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support and effectively manage this growth and our future operations, especially as we employ personnel in multiple geographic locations around the world.  We are subject to risks typical of international businesses, including differing economic conditions, differing customs, languages and customer expectations, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, including labor laws and customs, and foreign exchange rate volatility. \n Intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance. \n We compete with both online and traditional travel reservation services. The market for the travel reservation services we offer is intensely competitive, and current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost. Some of our current and potential competitors, such as Google, Apple and Microsoft, have access to significantly greater and more diversified resources than we do, and they may be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses (e.g., search or mobile device businesses) to enable them to compete more effectively with us. \n We currently or potentially will compete with a variety of companies, including: \n • Internet travel services such as Expedia, Hotels.com, Hotwire, Elong, CarRentals.com and Venere, which are owned by Expedia; Travelocity, lastminute.com, Holiday Auto and Zuji, which are owned by the Sabre Group; Orbitz.com, Cheaptickets, ebookers, HotelClub and RatesToGo, which are owned by Orbitz Worldwide; laterooms and asiarooms, which are owned by Tui Travel; Gullivers and octopustravel, which are owned by Kuoni; Hotel Reservation Service and hotel.de, which are owned by Hotel Reservation Service; and AutoEurope, Car Trawler, Ctrip, MakeMyTrip, Rakuten, Jalan and Wotif; \n • travel service providers such as hotel companies, airlines and rental car companies, many of which have their own branded websites to which they drive business, including joint efforts by travel service providers such as Room Key, an online hotel reservation service owned by several major hotel companies; \n • large online portal, social networking, group buying and search companies, such as Google, Yahoo! (including Yahoo! Travel), Bing (including Bing Travel), Facebook, Groupon and Living Social; \n • traditional travel agencies, wholesalers and tour operators; \n • online travel search services (generally referred to as “meta-search” services) such as KAYAK (which we agreed to acquire in November 2012; see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details about the acquisition), Trivago.com (in which Expedia agreed to acquire a majority ownership interest in December 2012), Mobissimo.com, FareChase.com, Qunar, Cheapflights.com and HotelsCombined and travel research services that have search functionality, such as TripAdvisor and Travelzoo; and \n • operators of travel industry reservation databases (generally referred to as a “global distribution system” or “GDS”) such as Galileo, Travelport, Amadeus and Sabre. \n Large, established Internet search engines with substantial resources and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating Internet traffic are creating - and we believe intend to further create - inroads into online travel, both in the United States and internationally.  For example, following its acquisition of ITA Software, Inc., a major flight information software company, Google launched a flight search tool that enables consumers to find fares, schedules and availability directly on Google and excludes participation by online travel agents ("OTAs") such as us within the search results.  Google has also invested in HomeAway, a publicly traded vacation home rental service, and launched “Hotel Finder,” a utility that allows consumers to search and compare hotel accommodations based on parameters set by the consumer and that Google has at times placed at or near the top of hotel-related search results.  In addition, Microsoft has launched Bing Travel , which searches for airfare and hotel reservations online and predicts the best time to purchase them.  If Google (the largest search engine in the world), Bing or other leading search engines refer significant traffic to these or other travel services they develop in the future, or otherwise favor supplier websites or other travel service websites over OTAs, including us, it would likely become more difficult and expensive for us to generate traffic to our websites and therefore to maintain or grow our market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n “Meta-search” services leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search results for the consumer's specific itinerary across travel service provider (e.g., airlines or hotels), OTA and other websites and, in many instances, compete directly with us for customers.  Furthermore, certain travel service providers limit OTA participation within the meta-search results.  Some meta-search services that offer customers the ability to make hotel reservations directly through their websites may evolve into more traditional OTAs.  Meta-search services intend to appeal to consumers by showing more detailed travel search results, including specific information for their own itineraries than may be available through OTAs or other websites, which could lead to travel service providers or others gaining a larger share of search traffic.  To the extent consumers book travel services through a meta-search site or directly with a supplier after visiting a meta-search site without using an OTA like us or if meta-search services limit our participation within their search results, we may need to increase our advertising or other customer acquisition costs to maintain or grow our bookings, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n Several major hotel companies, comprising Choice Hotels International, Hilton Worldwide, Hyatt, InterContinental Hotels Group, Wyndham Hotel Group, Marriott, La Quinta and Millennium, launched Room Key, an online hotel reservation service that competes directly with our hotel reservation services.  The hotel companies that own Room Key have a stated goal of driving consumers directly to their brand websites, thus reducing the share received by OTAs.  They may also attempt to improve their competitive position by offering lower room rates, better room availability or additional features or amenities through Room Key than are available through services like ours.  If Room Key is successful, our share of the online hotel reservation market could be negatively affected and our business could suffer. \n There has been a proliferation of new channels through which hotels can offer hotel room reservations.  For example, some hotels offer discounted room reservations through “daily deal” websites such as Groupon and Living Social, which sell coupons to customers at a substantial discount.  In 2011, Expedia, one of our largest competitors, entered into a partnership with Groupon to sell hotel room reservations to Groupon customers under the “Groupon Getaways” brand name. New entrants, such as BackBid, GuestMob and Tingo, as well as Hipmunk and Room 77, have developed new and differentiated offerings that endeavor to provide savings on hotel rooms to consumers and that compete directly with us.  If any of these new services are successful, we may experience less demand for our services and are likely to face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted hotel room rates. \n Competition in domestic online travel remains intense and online travel companies are creating new promotions and consumer value features in an effort to gain competitive advantages.  In particular, the competition to provide “opaque” hotel reservation services to consumers, an area in which our priceline.com U.S. business has been a leader, has become more intense.  For example, Expedia makes opaque hotel room reservations available on its principal website under the name “Expedia Unpublished Rates” and has supported this initiative with steeper discounts through lower margins.  As with our opaque Name Your Own Price ® hotel booking service, the name of the hotel is not disclosed until after booking.  We believe these offerings, in particular "Expedia Unpublished Rates", have adversely impacted the market share and year-over-year \n growth rate for our opaque hotel service, which experienced a decline in room night reservations in 2012 compared to 2011.  These and other competitors could also launch opaque rental car services, which could negatively impact our opaque Name Your Own Price ® rental car service.  If Expedia or others are successful in growing their opaque hotel reservation services, we may have less consumer demand for our hotel reservation services over time and we would face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted hotel room rates.  In an effort to compete more effectively against these new offerings, in 2012 we launched Express Deals , a semi-opaque price-disclosed hotel reservation service.  However, Express Deals may not be successful at recovering or growing domestic hotel reservation service market share.  As a result of this increased competition, our share of the discount hotel reservation market in the United States could further decrease, which would harm our business and results of operations. \n We believe that a number of reasons, including the recent significant year-over-year increase in retail airfares, could cause consumers to engage in increased shopping behavior before making a travel purchase than they engaged in previously.  Increased shopping behavior reduces our advertising efficiency and effectiveness because traffic becomes less likely to result in a purchase on our website, and such traffic is more likely to be obtained through paid online advertising channels than through free direct channels.  Further, as consumers attempt to be more efficient in their shopping behavior, they may favor travel services offered by search companies or meta-search sites over OTAs like us, which could reduce the traffic to our websites, increase consumer awareness of our competitors' brands and websites, increase our advertising and other customer acquisition costs and adversely affect our business, margins and results of operations. \n The launch of Room Key discussed above is demonstrative of the effort of many hotel, airline and rental car companies, including those with which we conduct business, to drive online demand to their own websites in lieu of third-party distributors such as us.  Certain airlines have attempted to charge additional fees to customers who book airline reservations through an online channel other than their own website.  Furthermore, some airlines may distribute their tickets exclusively through their own websites.  Providers who sell on their own websites typically do not charge a processing fee, and, in some instances, offer advantages such as web-only fares, bonus miles or loyalty points, which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than models like ours. \n We rely on online advertising channels to enhance our brand awareness and to generate a significant amount of traffic to our websites. \n We believe that maintaining and expanding the Booking.com, priceline.com, Agoda.com and rentalcars.com brands, along with our other owned brands, are important aspects of our efforts to attract and retain customers.  Effective online advertising has been an important factor in our growth and we believe it will continue to be important to our future success.  As our competitors spend increasingly more on advertising, we are required to spend more in order to maintain our brand recognition and, in the case of online advertising, to maintain and grow traffic to our websites.  In addition, we have invested considerable money and resources on the establishment and maintenance of the Booking.com, priceline.com, Agoda.com and rentalcars.com brands, and we will continue to invest resources in advertising, marketing and other brand building efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands.  We may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness and acceptance of these brands, and, even if we are successful in our branding efforts, such efforts may not be cost-effective.  If we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness and acceptance of our brands in a cost-effective manner, our business, market share and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. \n Our advertising efficiency is impacted by a number of factors that are subject to variability and that are outside of our control, including ADRs, costs per click, cancellation rates, foreign exchange rates and the extent to which we are successful in converting paid traffic to booking customers and then having customers return directly to our websites or mobile apps for future bookings.  We use online search engines, price comparison and travel research services, and affiliate marketing as primary means of generating traffic to our websites.  As a result, our online advertising expense has increased significantly in recent years, a trend we expect to continue.  In addition, our online advertising has grown faster than our gross profit due to (1) brand mix within the Priceline Group, (2) channel mix within our brands and (3) recently, lower returns on investment (“ROIs”) from our online advertising.  Our international brands are growing faster than our priceline.com U.S. brand, and spend a higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising.  Furthermore, our brands are generally obtaining an increasing share of traffic through paid online advertising channels.  Finally, our online advertising ROIs have recently been down year-over-year.  Any reduction in our advertising efficiency could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, whether through reduced gross profit, gross profit growth or through advertising expenses increasing faster than gross profit and thereby reducing margins and earnings growth. \n Recent trends in consumer adoption and use of mobile devices create new challenges and may enable device companies such as Apple to compete directly with us. \n Widespread adoption of mobile devices, such as the iPhone, Android-enabled smart phones, and tablets such as the iPad, coupled with the improved web browsing functionality and development of thousands of useful “apps” available on these devices, is driving substantial traffic and commerce activity to mobile platforms. We have experienced a significant shift of business to mobile platforms and our advertising partners are also seeing a rapid shift of traffic to mobile platforms.  Our major competitors and certain new market entrants are offering mobile applications for travel products and other functionality, including proprietary last-minute discounts for hotel bookings.  Advertising and distribution opportunities may be more limited on mobile devices given their smaller screen sizes.  The gross profit earned on a mobile transaction may be less than a typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing patterns. For example, hotel reservations made on a mobile device typically are for shorter lengths of stay and are not made as far in advance. Further, given the device sizes and technical limitations of tablets and smartphones, mobile consumers may not be willing to download multiple apps from multiple travel service providers and instead prefer to use one or a limited number of apps for their mobile travel activity.  As a result, the consumer experience with mobile apps as well as brand recognition and loyalty are likely to become increasingly important. We have made significant progress creating mobile offerings which have received strong reviews, solid download trends, and are driving a material and increasing share of our business.  We believe that mobile bookings present an opportunity for growth and are necessary to maintain and grow our business as consumers increasingly turn to mobile devices instead of a personal computer and to mobile applications instead of a web browser.  Further, many consumers use a mobile device based web browser instead of an app.  As a result, it is increasingly important for us to develop and maintain effective mobile websites optimized for mobile devices to provide customers with appealing easy-to-use mobile website functionality.  If we are unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new, user-friendly and differentiated mobile offerings and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platforms, or if our mobile apps are not downloaded and used by travel consumers, we could lose market share to existing competitors or new entrants and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected. \n Apple, one of the most successful companies in the world and producer of, among other things, the iPhone and iPad, recently obtained a patent for “iTravel,” a mobile app that would allow a traveler to check in for a travel reservation.  In addition, Apple's most recent iPhone operating system includes “Passbook,” a virtual wallet app that holds tickets, boarding passes, coupons and gift cards, and, along with iTravel, may be indicative of Apple's intent to enter the travel reservations business in some capacity.  Apple has substantial market share in the smart phone category and controls integration of offerings, including travel services, into its mobile operating system.  Apple also has more experience producing and developing mobile apps and has access to greater resources, than we have.  Apple may use or expand iTravel, Passbook, Siri (Apple's voice recognition "concierge" service) or another mobile app as a means of entering the travel reservations marketplace.  Similarly, Google's Android operating system is the leading smart phone operating system in the world.  As a result, Google could leverage its Android operating system to give its travel services a competitive advantage, either technically or with prominence on its Google Play app store or within its mobile search results. To the extent Apple or Google use their mobile operating systems or app distribution channels to favor their own travel service offerings, our business could be harmed. \n We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. \n We conduct a substantial majority of our business outside the United States but are reporting our results in U.S. Dollars.  As a result, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international business are translated from local currency (principally the Euro and the British Pound Sterling) into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation.  For example, a strengthening of the Euro increases our Euro-denominated net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, and net income as expressed in U.S. Dollars, while a weakening of the Euro decreases our Euro-denominated net assets, gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, and net income as expressed in U.S. Dollars.  Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency result in gains and losses that are reflected in our financial statements.  Greece, Ireland, Portugal and certain other European Union countries with high levels of sovereign debt have had difficulty refinancing their debt.  Concern around devaluation or abandonment of the Euro common currency, or that sovereign default risk may become more widespread and could include the United States, has led to significant volatility in the exchange rate between the Euro, the U.S. Dollar and other currencies.  Sovereign debt issues in the European Union could lead to further significant, and potentially longer-term, devaluation of the Euro against the U.S. Dollar, which would adversely impact our Euro-denominated net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses, and net income as expressed in U.S. Dollars. \n We rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire, retain and motivate qualified personnel, our business would be harmed. \n Our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization.  In particular, the contributions of certain key senior management in the United States, Europe and Asia are critical to the overall management of our business.  We may not be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees, the loss of whom could harm our business. \n In addition, competition for well-qualified employees in all aspects of our business, including software engineers, mobile communication talent and other technology professionals, is intense both in the United States and abroad.  Our international success in particular has led to increased efforts by our competitors and others to hire our international employees.  Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees.  If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business would be adversely affected. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policies. \n Our processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data exposes us to risks of internal or external security breaches and could give rise to liabilities. \n The security of data when engaging in electronic commerce is essential to maintaining customer and travel service provider confidence in our services.  Any security breach whether instigated internally or externally on our system or other Internet based systems could significantly harm our reputation and therefore our business, brand, market share and results of operations.  We currently require customers who use certain of our services to guarantee their offers with their credit card, either online or, in some instances, through our toll-free telephone service. It is possible that computer circumvention capabilities, new discoveries or advances or other developments, including our own acts or omissions, could result in a compromise or breach of customer transaction data. \n Our existing security measures may not be successful in preventing security breaches or attacks.  A party (whether internal, external, an affiliate or unrelated third party) that is able to circumvent our security systems could steal customer information or transaction data, proprietary information or cause significant interruptions in our operations.  For instance, from time to time, we have experienced “denial-of-service” type attacks on our systems that have made portions of our websites slow or unavailable for periods of time.  In addition, in 2012, several major companies, including Zappos, Apple, AOL, LinkedIn, Google, and Yahoo! experienced high-profile security breaches that exposed their users' personal information.  We expend significant resources to protect against security breaches, and we may need to increase our security related expenditures to maintain or increase our systems' security or to address problems caused and liabilities incurred by breaches.  Reductions in website availability and response time could cause loss of substantial business volumes during the occurrence of any such security breach or attack on our systems.  These issues are likely to become more difficult to manage as we expand the number of places where we operate and as the tools and techniques used in such attacks become more advanced.  Security breaches could result in negative publicity, damage our reputation, expose us to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject us to regulatory penalties and sanctions.  Security breaches could also cause customers and potential customers to lose confidence in our security and choose to use the services of our competitors, which would have a negative effect on the value of our brand, our market share and our results of operations.  Our insurance policies carry low coverage limits, and would likely not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches. \n We also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties conducting business over the Internet. Consumers generally are concerned with security and privacy on the Internet, and any publicized security problems could inhibit the growth of the Internet and consumers' willingness to provide private information or effect commercial transactions on the Internet and, therefore, our services.  Additionally, security breaches at third parties such as travel service provider or distributor systems upon which we rely could result in negative publicity, damage our reputation, expose us to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject us to regulatory penalties and sanctions.  Some of our business is conducted with third party marketing affiliates, which may generate travel reservations through our infrastructure or through other systems.  A security breach at such a third party could be perceived by consumers as a security breach of our systems and could result in negative publicity, damage our reputation, expose us to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject us to regulatory penalties and sanctions.  In addition, such third parties may not comply with applicable disclosure requirements, which could expose us to liability. \n In our processing of travel transactions, we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable data.  This data is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, including the Commission of the European Union through its Data Protection Directive and variations of that directive in the member states of the European Union.  This government action is typically intended to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected, processed and \n transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction.  In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries.  These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  Non-compliance with these laws could result in penalties or significant legal liability.  We could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities. \n As an international business providing travel reservation services around the world, we are subject to income taxes and non-income based taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities.  Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.  The U.S. Internal Revenue Service initiated an audit of our 2009 and 2010 federal income tax returns for the first time in the third quarter of 2011.  We reached an agreement with the IRS in June 2012 which covered all tax periods through December 31, 2010 and had no impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  To date, we have been audited in several taxing jurisdictions with no significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  If future audits find that additional taxes are due, we may be subject to incremental tax liabilities, possibly including interest and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.  For example, French authorities have initiated a process to determine whether we should be subject to additional tax obligations in France.  It is our understanding that several large companies, including Google and Microsoft, are involved in similar investigations in France.  While we believe that we comply with French tax law, French tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes, and may also assess penalties and interest.  In general, governments in the United States and Europe are increasingly focused on ways to increase revenues, which has contributed to an increase in audit activity and harsher stances taken by tax authorities.  Any such additional taxes or other assessments may be in excess of our current tax provisions or may require us to modify our business practices in order to reduce our exposure to additional taxes in France going forward, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n We will be subject to increased income taxes in the event that our foreign cash balances are remitted to the United States.  As of December 31, 2012, we held approximately $3.1 billion of cash and short-term investments outside of the United States.  To date, we have used our foreign cash to reinvest in our foreign operations.  It is our current intention to reinvest our foreign cash in our foreign operations.  If our foreign cash balances continue to grow and our ability to reinvest those balances diminishes, it will become increasingly likely that we will repatriate some of our foreign cash balances to the United States.  In such event, we would likely be subject to additional income tax expense in the United States with respect to our unremitted foreign earnings.  We would not incur additional income tax payments unless we were to actually repatriate our international cash balances to the United States.  We would only incur federal alternative minimum tax and certain state income taxes as long as we have net operating loss carryforwards available to offset our U.S. taxable income.  Additionally, if we were to repatriate foreign cash to the United States, it would use a portion of our domestic net operating loss carryforwards which could result in us being subject to income taxes on the earnings of our domestic business sooner than would otherwise have been the case. \n In addition, U.S. President Barack Obama's Administration has proposed significant changes to the U.S. international tax laws that include limiting U.S. deductions for interest expense related to un-repatriated foreign-source income and putting in place an "offshoring tax" that would set a minimum tax on offshore earnings.  We cannot determine whether all of these proposals will be enacted into law or what, if any, changes may be made to such proposals prior to being enacted into law.  If the U.S. tax laws change in a manner that increases our tax obligation, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. \n We are also subject to non-income based taxes, such as value-added, payroll, sales, use, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, as well as the potential for hotel occupancy and other related taxes in the United States as discussed below.  From time to time, we are under audit by tax authorities with respect to these non-income based taxes and may have exposure to additional non-income based tax liabilities. \n Adverse application of state and local tax laws could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n A number of jurisdictions in the United States have initiated lawsuits against online travel companies, including us, related to, among other things, the payment of hotel occupancy and other related taxes (e.g., state and local sales tax and general excise tax).  In addition, a number of U.S. states, counties and municipalities have initiated audit proceedings, issued proposed tax assessments or started inquiries relating to the payment of hotel occupancy and other related taxes.  See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of these pending cases and proceedings.  Additional state and local jurisdictions are likely to assert that we are subject to, among other things, hotel occupancy and other related taxes and could seek to collect such taxes, either retroactively or prospectively, or both. \n In connection with some hotel occupancy tax audits and assessments, we may be required to pay any assessed taxes, which amounts may be substantial, prior to being allowed to contest the assessments and the applicability of the laws in judicial proceedings.  This requirement is commonly referred to as “pay to play” or “pay first.”  Payment of these amounts, if any, is not an admission that we believe that we are subject to such taxes and, even if we make such payments, we intend to continue to vigorously assert our position that we should not be subject to such taxes. \n Litigation is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse developments in these pending or future cases and proceedings.  For example, in September 2012, the Superior Court in the District of Columbia granted a summary judgment in favor of the city and against online travel companies.  As a result, we are required to remit sales tax on our margin and we increased our accrual for hotel occupancy and other related taxes, with a corresponding charge to cost of revenues, by approximately $4.8 million (including estimated interest and penalties) in September 2012.  Similarly, in January 2013, the Tax Appeal Court for the State of Hawaii held that online travel companies, including us, are liable for the State's general excise tax on the full amount the online travel company collects from the customer for a hotel reservation, without any offset for amounts passed through to the hotel.  As a result, we increased our accrual for hotel occupancy and other related taxes, with a corresponding charge to cost of revenues, by approximately $16.5 million (including estimated interest and penalties) in December 2012.  We intend to appeal this decision, and we may be required to pay all or some of that amount prior to proceeding with the appeal.  These decisions and any similar decisions in other jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, margins and results of operations.  An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending litigation may encourage the commencement of additional litigation, audit proceedings or other regulatory inquiries.  In addition, an unfavorable outcome or settlement of these actions or proceedings could result in substantial liabilities for past and/or future bookings, including, among other things, interest, penalties, punitive damages and/or attorney fees and costs.  There have been, and will continue to be, substantial ongoing costs, which may include “pay first” payments, associated with defending our position in pending and any future cases or proceedings. An adverse outcome in one or more of these unresolved proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could be material to our results of operations or cash flows in any given operating period. \n To the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that we have a tax collection responsibility, or we determine that we have such a responsibility, with respect to future transactions, we may collect any such additional tax obligation from our customers, which would have the effect of increasing the cost of hotel reservations to our customers and, consequently, could make our hotel reservation service less competitive (i.e., versus the websites of other OTCs or hotel company websites) and reduce hotel reservation transactions; alternatively, we could choose to reduce the compensation for our services on merchant hotel transactions.  Either action could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n In many of the judicial and other proceedings initiated to date, the taxing jurisdictions seek not only historical taxes that are claimed to be owed on our gross profit, but also, among other things, interest, penalties, punitive damages and/or attorney fees and costs.  Therefore, any liability associated with hotel occupancy tax matters is not constrained to our liability for tax owed on our historical gross profit, but may also include, among other things, penalties, interest and attorneys' fees.  To date, the majority of the taxing jurisdictions in which we facilitate hotel reservations have not asserted that taxes are due and payable on our U.S. merchant hotel business.  With respect to taxing jurisdictions that have not initiated proceedings to date, it is possible that they will do so in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statutes and seek to collect taxes from us only on a prospective basis. \n Our stock price is highly volatile. \n The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following, some of which are beyond our control: \n • operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors; \n • quarterly variations in our operating results; \n • changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors; \n • worldwide economic conditions in general and in Europe in particular; \n • fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro; \n • announcements of technological innovations or new services by us or our competitors; \n • changes in our capital structure; \n • changes in market valuations of other Internet or online service companies; \n • announcements by us or our competitors of price reductions, promotions, significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; \n • loss of a major travel service provider participant, such as a hotel chain, rental car company or airline, from our services; \n • changes in the status of our intellectual property rights; \n • lack of success in the expansion of our business model geographically; \n • announcements by third parties of significant claims or initiation of proceedings against us or adverse developments in pending proceedings; \n • occurrences of a significant security breach; \n • additions or departures of key personnel; and \n • trading volume fluctuations. \n Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock by introducing a large number of sellers to the market.  Given the volatility that exists for our shares, such sales could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly.  In addition, fluctuations in our stock price and our price-to-earnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction, particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis. \n The trading prices of Internet company stocks in general, including ours, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations.  To the extent that the public's perception of the prospects of Internet or e-commerce companies is negative, our stock price could decline, regardless of our results.  Other broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.  Market fluctuations, as well as general political and economic conditions, such as a recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations, also may decrease the market price of our common stock.  Negative market conditions could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or the value of our stock for purposes of acquiring other companies or businesses. \n We have, in the past, been a defendant in securities class action litigation.  Securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities.  To the extent our stock price declines or is volatile, we may in the future be the target of additional litigation. This additional litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n We may not be able to maintain our “Innovation Box Tax” benefit. \n Effective January 1, 2010, the Netherlands modified its corporate income tax law related to income generated from qualifying “innovative” activities (the “Innovation Box Tax”).  Earnings that qualify for the Innovation Box Tax are taxed at the rate of 5% rather than the Dutch statutory rate of 25%.  Booking.com obtained a ruling from the Dutch tax authorities in February 2011 confirming that a portion of its earnings (“qualifying earnings”) is eligible for Innovation Box Tax treatment.  The ruling from the Dutch tax authorities is valid from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2014, which includes a one year extension granted by the Dutch tax authorities in August 2012. \n In order to be eligible for Innovation Box Tax treatment, Booking.com must, among other things, apply for and obtain a research and development (“R&D”) certificate from a Dutch governmental agency every six months confirming that the activities that Booking.com intends to be engaged in over the subsequent six month period are “innovative.”  The R&D certificate is current but should Booking.com fail to secure such a certificate in any future period - for example, because the governmental agency does not view Booking.com's new or anticipated activities as innovative - or should this agency determine that the activities contemplated to be performed in a prior period were not performed as contemplated or did not \n comply with the agency's requirements, Booking.com may lose its certificate and, as a result, the Innovation Box Tax benefit may be reduced or eliminated. \n Booking.com intends to apply for continued Innovation Box Tax treatment for future periods.  However, Booking.com's application may not be accepted, or, if accepted, the amount of qualifying earnings may be reduced or the applicable tax rate on qualifying earnings may be higher than the current rate.  In addition, the tax law may change resulting in a reduction or elimination of the tax benefit.  The loss of the Innovation Box Tax benefit would increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our results of operations. \n We are dependent on providers of hotel rooms, rental cars and airline tickets. \n We rely on providers of hotel rooms, rental cars and airline tickets to make their services available to our customers through us.  Our arrangements with the hotel, rental car and airline providers generally do not require them to make available any specific quantity of hotel room reservations, rental cars or airline tickets, or to make hotel room reservations, rental cars or airline tickets available for any particular route, in any geographic area or at any particular price.  During the course of our business, we are in continuous dialogue with our major providers about the nature and extent of their participation in our system. A significant reduction on the part of any of our major travel service providers or providers that are particularly popular with customers of their participation in our system for a sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal could have a material adverse effect on our business, market share and results of operations.  To the extent any of those major or popular travel service providers ceased to participate in our system in favor of one of our competitors' systems or decided to require consumers to purchase services directly from them, our business, market share and results of operations could be harmed. \n Our business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics or traffic-generating arrangements. \n We utilize Internet search engines and other travel demand aggregation websites, principally through the purchase of travel-related keywords, to generate traffic to our websites.  In particular, we rely to a significant extent upon Google to generate business and, to a much lesser extent, other search engines and other travel demand aggregation websites.  Search engines such as Google frequently update and change the logic which determines the placement and display of results of a consumer's search, such that the placement of links to our sites can be negatively affected.  For example, Google launched “Hotel Finder,” a utility that allows consumers to search and compare hotel accommodations based on parameters set by the consumer and that Google has at times placed at or near the top of hotel-related search results.  If Google changes its search algorithms in a manner that is competitively disadvantageous to us, whether to support its own travel related services or otherwise, our ability to generate traffic to our websites would be harmed, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, market share and results of operations. \n A significant amount of our website traffic is directed to our websites through participation in pay-per-click advertising campaigns on Internet search engines whose pricing and operating dynamics can experience rapid change commercially, technically and competitively.  In addition, we purchase website traffic from a number of sources, including some operated by our competitors, in the form of pay-per-click arrangements that can be terminated with little or no notice.  If one or more of such arrangements is terminated, our business, market share and results of operations could be adversely affected. \n In addition, we rely on various third party distribution channels (i.e., marketing affiliates) to distribute hotel room and rental car reservations.  Should one or more of such third parties cease distribution of reservations made through us, or suffer deterioration in its search engine ranking, due to changes in search engine algorithms or otherwise, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected. \n Our pending acquisition of KAYAK is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. \n Completion of our pending acquisition of KAYAK Software Corporation is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.  The acquisition is subject to conditions beyond our and KAYAK's control, including regulatory approval and approval by KAYAK's stockholders.  We and KAYAK may be unable to obtain the required approvals in a timely manner or at all.  If the acquisition is not completed, the price of our common stock may decline, costs related to the acquisition, such as financial advisory, legal, accounting and printing fees, must be paid and we would fail to realize any of the strategic benefits expected to result from the acquisition. \n Uncertainty regarding the completion of the acquisition may cause consumers, travel service providers and advertisers to delay or defer decisions concerning KAYAK's services.  Some of our competitors, such as Expedia, have commercial arrangements with KAYAK that they may decide to terminate or not renew in the event the acquisition closes out of \n competitive concerns related to our ownership of KAYAK.  In addition, diversion of management focus and resources from the day-to-day operation of the business to matters relating to the acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or KAYAK's business. Current and prospective KAYAK employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us if the acquisition is completed. This may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key KAYAK management, sales, marketing, operations and technical personnel. \n If our pending acquisition of KAYAK is completed, we will be subject to risks associated with KAYAK's business.  Such risks include: continued access to information travel services provided by other OTAs and travel service providers; reduction in advertising on KAYAK's websites by competitors of ours; and KAYAK's ability to expand its offerings into international markets.  Further, integration of or transition from KAYAK's business processes, controls, IT systems, employment policies and other similar policies, procedures or systems may involve significant time and resources, and could result in significant diversion of management focus and resources from the operation of our business and KAYAK's business. \n System capacity constraints and system failures could harm our business. \n We have experienced rapid growth in customer traffic to our websites and through our mobile apps, the number of hotels on our extranets and the geographic breadth of our operations.  If our systems cannot be expanded to cope with increased demand or fail to perform, we could experience unanticipated disruptions in service, slower response times, decreased customer service and customer satisfaction and delays in the introduction of new services, any of which could impair our reputation, damage our brands and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.  While we do maintain redundant systems and hosting services, it is possible that we could experience an interruption in our business, and we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may occur. \n Our computer hardware for operating our services is currently located at hosting facilities around the world.  These systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures and similar events.  They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct.  Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of any disruption of service due to any such misconduct, natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at such facilities, or the failure by such facilities to provide our required data communications capacity could result in lengthy interruptions or delays in our services.  Any system failure that causes an interruption or delay in service could impair our reputation, damage our brands or result in consumers choosing to use a competitive service, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n We rely on certain third party computer systems and third party service providers, including GDSs and computerized central reservation systems of the hotel, rental car and airline industries to satisfy demand for our airline tickets and a portion of our priceline.com U.S. business hotel room reservations and car rental reservations.  Any interruption in these third party services systems or deterioration in their performance could prevent us from booking related hotel room, rental car and airline reservations and have a material adverse effect on our business, our brands and our results of operations.  Our agreements with some third party service providers are terminable upon short notice and often do not provide recourse for service interruptions.  In the event our arrangement with any of such third parties is terminated, we may not be able to find an alternative source of systems support on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms and, as a result, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n We depend upon various third parties to process credit cards for our merchant transactions around the world.  In addition, we rely on third parties to provide credit card numbers which we use as a payment mechanism for merchant hotel transactions.  If any such third party were wholly or partially compromised, our cash flows could be disrupted or we may not be able to generate merchant hotel transactions (and related revenues) until such a time as a replacement process could be put in place with a different vendor. \n We do not have a completely formalized or comprehensive disaster recovery plan in every geographic region in which we conduct business.  In the event of certain system failures, we may not be able to switch to back-up systems immediately and the time to full recovery could be prolonged.  Like many online businesses, we have experienced system failures from time to time. In addition to placing increased burdens on our engineering staff, these outages create a significant amount of user questions and complaints that need to be addressed by our customer support personnel.  Any unscheduled interruption in our service could result in an immediate loss of revenues that can be substantial, increase customer service cost, harm our reputation and cause some consumers to switch to our competitors.  If we experience frequent or persistent system failures, our reputation and brand could be permanently and significantly harmed.  We have taken and continue to take steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems.  These steps are expensive, may reduce our margins and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime. \n We use both internally developed systems and third-party systems to operate our services, including transaction processing, order management and financial systems.  If the number of consumers using our services increases substantially, or if critical third-party systems stop operating as designed, we will need to significantly expand and upgrade our technology, transaction processing systems, financial and accounting systems and other infrastructure.  We may not be able to upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such conditions in a timely manner, and, depending on the third-party systems affected, our transactional, financial and accounting systems could be impacted for a meaningful amount of time before upgrade, expansion or repair. \n Our financial results will likely be materially impacted by payment of income taxes in the future. \n Until our domestic net operating loss carryforwards are utilized or expire, we do not expect to make tax payments on our U.S. income, except for U.S. federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes.  However, we expect to pay foreign taxes on our foreign income.  We expect that our international business will continue to generate most of our revenues and profits and will continue to grow pretax income at a higher rate than our U.S. business and, therefore, we expect that our tax payments will continue to increase.  Any increase in our effective tax rate would have an adverse effect on our results of operations. \n We may not be able to keep up with rapid technological changes. \n The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, consolidation, frequent new service announcements, introductions and enhancements and changing consumer demands. We may not be able to keep up with these rapid changes.  In addition, these market characteristics are heightened by the progress of technology adoption in various markets, including the continuing adoption of the Internet and online commerce in certain geographies and the emergence and growth of the use of smart phones and tablets for mobile e-commerce transactions, including through the increasing use of mobile apps.  As a result, our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, to adapt our services to evolving industry standards and to continually improve the performance, features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service offerings and the evolving demands of the marketplace.  In particular, we believe that it will be increasingly important for us to effectively offer our services through mobile applications and mobile optimized websites on smart phones and tablets.  Any failure by us to successfully develop and achieve customer adoption of our mobile applications and mobile optimized websites would likely have a material and adverse effect on our growth, market share, business and results of operations.  We believe that ease-of-use, comprehensive functionality and the look and feel of our mobile apps and mobile optimized websites will be increasingly competitively critical as consumers obtain more of their travel services through mobile devices.  As a result, we intend to continue to spend significant resources maintaining, developing and enhancing our websites, mobile apps and mobile optimized websites and other technology.  In addition, the widespread adoption of new Internet, networking or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes could require us to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our services or infrastructure to those new technologies. \n Regulatory and legal requirements and uncertainties could harm our business. \n The services we offer are subject to regulations (including without limitation laws, ordinances, rules and other regulations) of national and local governments and regulatory authorities around the world, many of which are evolving and subject to the possibility of new or revised interpretations.  Our ability to provide our services is and will continue to be affected by such regulations.  The implementation of unfavorable regulations or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by judicial or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs, cause the development of the affected markets to become impractical and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n Compliance with foreign and U.S. laws and regulations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions.  These laws and regulations include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and local laws which also prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or third parties, data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, antitrust or competition laws, U.S., E.U. or U.N. sanctioned country or sanctioned persons mandates, and consumer protection laws.  Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and/or criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees and/or prohibitions on the conduct of our business.  Any such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our services in one or more countries, could delay or prevent potential acquisitions, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brands, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties.  We are also subject to a variety of other regulatory and legal risks and challenges in managing an organization operating in various countries, including those related to: \n • regulatory changes or other government actions; \n • additional complexity to comply with regulations in multiple jurisdictions, as well as overlapping or inconsistent legal regimes, in particular with respect to tax, labor, consumer protection, digital content, advertising, promotions, privacy and anti-trust laws; \n • our ability to repatriate funds held by our foreign subsidiaries to the United States at favorable tax rates; \n • difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries; and \n • reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries. \n Our business has grown substantially over the last several years and continues to expand into new geographical locations.  In addition, we have made efforts and expect to make further efforts to integrate access to travel services across our various brands.  These changes add complexity to legal and tax compliance, and our increased size and operating history may increase the likelihood that we will be subject to audits by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. \n In July 2012, the Office of Fair Trading (the "OFT"), the competition authority in the United Kingdom, issued a “Statement of Objections” (“SO”) to Booking.com, which sets out the OFT's preliminary views on why it believes Booking.com and others in the online hotel reservation sector have allegedly breached E.U. and U.K. competition law.  The SO alleges, among other things, that there are agreements or concerted practices between hotels and Booking.com and at least one other online travel company that restrict Booking.com's (and the other travel company's) ability to discount hotel room reservations, which the OFT alleges is a form of resale price maintenance.  We dispute the allegations against Booking.com in the SO and intend to contest them vigorously.  Booking.com runs an agency model hotel reservation platform in which hotels have complete discretion and control over setting the prices that appear on the Booking.com website. Booking.com is a facilitator of hotel room reservations; it does not take possession of or title to hotel rooms and is not a reseller of hotel rooms. Because Booking.com plays no role in price setting, does not control hotel pricing and does not resell hotel rooms, it does not believe that it engages in the conduct alleged in the SO.  We will have the right to respond to the allegations in the SO in writing and orally.  If the OFT chooses to maintain its objections after hearing Booking.com's responses, the OFT will issue a “Decision” which will state its case against Booking.com and others under investigation.  We expect that a final infringement Decision, if any, will be issued at the earliest in the second half of 2013.  We will have the opportunity, should we choose to do so, to challenge an adverse Decision by the OFT in the U.K. courts.  In connection with a Decision, the OFT may impose a fine against Booking.com. We estimate that a fine could range from $0 to approximately $50 million.  A fine in this amount could adversely impact our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, the OFT may require changes to Booking.com's business practices, including changes to its approach to pricing and the use of “Most Favored Nation” clauses in contracts with hotels.  We are unable at this time to predict the outcome of the proceedings before the OFT and, if necessary, before the U.K. courts, and the impact of changes to our business practices that may be required, if any, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are also unable to predict at this time the extent to which other regulatory authorities may pursue similar claims against us. \n Newly enacted “cookie” laws could negatively impact the way we do business. \n On June 5, 2012, an amendment to the Dutch Telecommunications Act became effective.  One of the provisions of the amended act is a new regulation on the use of “cookies.”  A “cookie” is a text file that is stored on a user's web browser by a website.  Cookies are common tools used by thousands of websites, such as Booking.com, which is based in the Netherlands, and priceline.com, to, among other things, store or gather information (e.g., remember log-on details so a user does not have to re-enter them when revisiting a site) and enhance the user experience on a website.  Cookies are valuable tools for websites like Booking.com and priceline.com to improve customer experience and increase conversion on their websites. \n The amended act requires websites, such as Booking.com, to provide Dutch users with clear and comprehensive information about the storage and use of certain cookies and obtain prior consent from the user before placing certain cookies on a user's web browser.  Consent may be accomplished by asking a user to check a box to consent to the use of the cookies before proceeding on the website (“opt-in” consent). \n The amended act implements certain provisions of the European Union's ePrivacy Directive, which requires member countries to adopt regulations governing the use of “cookies” by websites servicing customers from the European Union.  Compliance with the amended act, as well as any similarly restrictive “cookie” regulations that may be adopted by other European Union countries requiring “opt-in” consent before certain cookies can be placed on a user's web browser, might adversely affect our ability, in particular, Booking.com's ability, to serve certain customers in the manner we currently do and impair our ability to continue to improve and optimize performance on our websites, which could in turn negatively affect a \n customer's experience using our services.  As a result, these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, market share and results of operations. \n We face risks related to our intellectual property. \n We regard our intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our proprietary rights.  If we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, brands and results of operations. \n While we believe that our issued patents and pending patent applications help to protect our business, there can be no assurance that: \n • a third party will not have or obtain one or more patents that can prevent us from practicing features of our business or that will require us to pay for a license to use those features; \n • our operations do not or will not infringe valid, enforceable patents of third parties; \n • we can successfully defend our patents against challenges by third parties; \n • pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents; \n • competitors or potential competitors will not devise new methods of competing with us that are not covered by our patents or patent applications; \n • because of variations in the application of our business model to each of our services, our patents will be effective in preventing one or more third parties from utilizing a copycat business model to offer the same service in one or more categories; \n • new prior art will not be discovered that may diminish the value of or invalidate an issued patent; or \n • legislative or judicial action will not directly or indirectly affect the scope and validity of any of our patent rights. \n There has been recent discussion in the press regarding the examination and issuance of so called “business method” patents.  As a result, the United States Patent and Trademark Office has indicated that it intends to intensify the review process applicable to such patent applications.  The new procedures are not expected to have a direct effect on patents already granted. We cannot anticipate what effect, if any, the new review process will have on our pending patent applications.  In addition, there has been recent discussion in various federal court proceedings regarding the patentability and validity of business method patents.  The U.S. Supreme Court, in Bilski v. Kappos , partially addressed the patentability of so-called business methods.  We cannot anticipate what effect, if any, any new federal court decision or new legislation will have on our issued patents or pending patent applications. \n We pursue the registration of our trademarks and service marks in the United States and internationally.  However, effective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services are made available online.  We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties.  These licensees may take actions that might diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. \n From time to time, in the ordinary course of our business, we have been subject to, and are currently subject to, legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect that third parties will continue to assert intellectual property claims, in particular patent claims, against us, particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business.  We endeavor to defend our intellectual property rights diligently, but intellectual property litigation is extremely expensive and time consuming, and has and is likely to continue to divert managerial attention and resources from our business objectives.  Successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from operating our business, or portions of our business.  In addition, resolution of claims may require us to obtain licenses to use intellectual property rights belonging to third parties, which may be expensive to procure, or possibly to cease using those rights altogether.  Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. \n Our business is exposed to risks associated with processing credit card transactions. \n Our results have been negatively impacted by purchases made using fraudulent credit cards.  Because we act as the merchant of record in a majority of our priceline.com transactions as well as those of Agoda.com and rentalcars.com, we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our websites as well as other payment disputes with our customers.  Additionally, we are held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when we do not act as merchant of record.  Accordingly, we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card chargebacks.  If we are unable to combat the use of fraudulent credit cards on our websites, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n In addition, in the event that one of our major suppliers voluntarily or involuntarily declares bankruptcy, we could experience an increase in credit card chargebacks from customers with travel reservations with such supplier.  For example, airlines that participate in our system and declare bankruptcy or cease operations may be unable or unwilling to honor tickets sold for their flights.  Our policy in such event is to direct customers seeking a refund or exchange to the airline, and not to provide a remedy ourselves.  Because we are the merchant-of-record on sales of Name Your Own Price ® airline tickets to our customers, however, we could experience a significant increase in demands for refunds or credit card chargebacks from customers, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  For example, in April 2008, Aloha Airlines and ATA Airlines each ceased operations and we experienced an increase in credit card chargebacks from customers with tickets on those airlines.  Agoda.com and rentalcars.com process credit card transactions and operate in numerous currencies.  Credit card costs are typically higher for foreign currency transactions and in instances where cancellations occur. \n We are party to legal proceedings which, if adversely decided, could materially adversely affect us. \n We are a party to the legal proceedings described in Part I. Item 3. below, and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  These actions may increase our expenses and an adverse outcome in any of such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  However, we believe that adverse determinations in more of the pending proceedings than currently anticipated would not have a material impact on our liquidity due to our available cash resources. \n Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated. \n We have invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions.  Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital, and unidentified issues not discovered in our investigations and evaluations of those strategies and acquisitions.  We may decide to make minority investments, including through joint ventures, in which we have limited or no management or operational control.  The controlling person in such a case may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and decisions of the company or venture in which we invested may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investment.  Further, we may issue shares of our common stock in these transactions, which could result in dilution to our stockholders.
