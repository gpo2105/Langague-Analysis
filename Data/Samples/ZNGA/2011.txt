Our business is subject to many risks. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, operating results, financial condition
and the trading price of our Class A common stock could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 
 If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with Facebook, our business will suffer. 
 Facebook is the primary distribution, marketing, promotion and payment platform for our games. We generate substantially all of our
revenue and players through the Facebook platform and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Any deterioration in our relationship with Facebook would harm our business and adversely affect our operating results. 
 We are subject to Facebooks standard terms and conditions for application developers, which govern the promotion, distribution and
operation of games and other applications on the Facebook platform. We have entered into an addendum to these terms and conditions pursuant to which we have agreed to use Facebook Credits, Facebooks proprietary payment method, as the primary
means of payment within our games played through Facebook. This addendum expires in May 2015. 
 Our business would be harmed if: 
 Facebook discontinues or limits access to its platform by us and other game developers; 
 Facebook terminates or does not renew our addendum; 
 Facebook modifies its terms of service or other policies, including fees charged to, or other restrictions on, us or other application developers, or
Facebook changes how the personal information of its users is made available to application developers on the Facebook platform or shared by users; 
 Facebook establishes more favorable relationships with one or more of our competitors; or 
 Facebook develops its own competitive offerings. 
 We have benefited from Facebooks strong brand recognition and large user base. If Facebook loses its market position or otherwise falls out of favor with Internet users, we would need to identify
alternative channels for marketing, promoting and distributing our games, which would consume substantial resources and may not be effective. In addition, Facebook has broad discretion to change its terms of service and other policies with respect
to us and other developers, and those changes may be unfavorable to us. For example, in 2010 Facebook adopted a policy requiring applications on Facebook accept only its virtual currency, Facebook Credits, as payment from users. As a result of this
change, which we completed in April 2011, Facebook receives a greater share of payments made by our players than it did when other payment options were allowed. Future bookings and revenue may be negatively impacted if our current game card program
is not extended beyond April 30, 2012. Our contract with Facebook allows us to continue to distribute our game cards until April 30, 2012. Facebook may also change its fee structure, add fees associated with access to and use of the
Facebook platform, change how the personal information of its users is made available to application developers on the Facebook platform or restrict how Facebook users can share information with friends on their platform. Beginning in early 2010,
Facebook changed its policies for application developers regarding use of its communication channels. These changes limited the level of communication among users about applications on the Facebook platform. As a result, the number of our players on
Facebook declined. Any such changes in the future could significantly alter how players experience our games or interact within our games, which may harm our business. 
 We operate in a new and rapidly changing industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects. 
 Social games, through which we derive substantially all of our revenue, is a new and rapidly evolving industry. The growth of the social game industry and the level of demand and market acceptance of our
games are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Our future operating results will depend on numerous factors affecting the social game industry, many of which are beyond our control, including: 
 continued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of Facebook and other social networks; 
 changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences; 
 the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment; 
 the worldwide growth of personal computer, broadband Internet and mobile device users, and the rate of any such growth; and 
 general economic conditions, particularly economic conditions adversely affecting discretionary consumer spending. 
 Our ability to plan for game development, distribution and promotional activities will be significantly affected by our ability to
anticipate and adapt to relatively rapid changes in the tastes and preferences of our current and potential players. New and different types of entertainment may increase in popularity at the expense of social games. A decline in the popularity of
social games in general, or our games in particular would harm our business and prospects. 
 We have a new business model and a short operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our
prospects and future financial results and may increase the risk that we will not be successful. 
 We began operations
in April 2007, and we have a short operating history and a new business model, which makes it difficult to effectively assess our future prospects. Our business model is based on offering games that are free to play. To date, only a small portion of
our players pay for virtual goods. 
 We rely on a small portion of our total players for nearly all of our revenue. 
 Compared to all players who play our games in any period, only a small portion are paying players. During the three months ended
December 31, 2011, we had approximately 2.9 million MUPs (excluding payers who use certain payment methods for which unique payer data is not available). We lose players in the ordinary course of business. In order to sustain our revenue
levels, we must attract, retain and increase the number of players or more effectively monetize our players. To retain players, we must devote significant resources so that the games they play retain their interest and attract them to our other
games. If we fail to grow or sustain the number of our players, or if the rates at which we attract and retain players declines or if the average amount our players pay declines, our business may not grow and our financial results will suffer. 
 We expect our bookings and revenue growth rate to decline and anticipate operating margins may decline in the future. 
 From 2010 to 2011, our revenue grew from $597.5 million to $1.14 billion, which represents an annual growth rate of
approximately 91%. We expect that as our bookings and revenue increases the growth rate in bookings and revenue will decline. We believe our operating margin will also experience downward pressure as a result of increasing competition and the need
for increased operating expenditures for many aspects of our business in addition to increased stock-based compensation expense associated with vested restricted stock units, or ZSUs, which we had not recognized prior to the initial public offering.
We also expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on game development, international expansion and our network infrastructure. 
 A small number of games have generated a majority of our revenue, and we must continue to launch and enhance games that attract and retain a significant number of players in order to grow our
revenue and sustain our competitive position. 
 Historically we have depended on a small number of games for a majority
of our revenue and we expect that this dependency will continue for the foreseeable future. Our growth depends on our ability to consistently launch new games that achieve significant popularity. Each of our games requires significant engineering,
marketing and other resources to develop, launch and sustain via regular upgrades and expansions, and such costs on average have increased. Our ability to successfully launch, sustain and expand games and attract and retain players largely will
depend on our ability to: 
 anticipate and effectively respond to changing game player interests and preferences; 
 anticipate or respond to changes in the competitive landscape; 
 attract, retain and motivate talented game designers, product managers and engineers; 
 develop, sustain and expand games that are fun, interesting and compelling to play; 
 effectively market new games and enhancements to our existing players and new players; 
 minimize launch delays and cost overruns on new games and game expansions; 
 minimize downtime and other technical difficulties; and 
 acquire high quality assets, personnel and companies. 
 It is difficult to consistently anticipate player demand on a large scale, particularly as
we develop games in new genres or new markets, including international markets and mobile platforms. If we do not successfully launch games that attract and retain a significant number of players and extend the life of our existing games, our market
share, reputation and financial results will be harmed. 
 If our top games do not maintain their popularity, our results of operations
could be harmed. 
 In addition to creating new games that are attractive to a significant number of players, we must
extend the life of our existing games, in particular our most successful games. For a game to remain popular, we must constantly enhance, expand or upgrade the game with new features that players find attractive. Such constant enhancement requires
the investment of significant resources, particularly with older games and such costs on average have increased. We may not be able to successfully enhance, expand or upgrade our current games. Any reduction in the number of players of our most
popular games, any decrease in the popularity of our games or social games in general, any breach of game-related security or prolonged server interruption, any loss of rights to any intellectual property underlying such games, or any other adverse
developments relating to our most popular games, could harm our results of operations. 
 Any failure or significant interruption in our
network could impact our operations and harm our business. 
 Our technology infrastructure is critical to the
performance of our games and to player satisfaction. Our games run on a complex distributed system, or what is commonly known as cloud computing. We own, operate and maintain the primary elements of this system, but some elements of this system are
operated by third parties that we do not control and which would require significant time to replace. We expect this dependence on third parties to continue. In particular, a meaningful portion of our game traffic is hosted by Amazon Web Services
(AWS). In the fourth quarter of 2011, AWS hosted approximately one-third of our game traffic. AWS provides us with computing and storage capacity pursuant to an agreement that continues until terminated by either party. We have
experienced, and may in the future experience, website disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors and capacity constraints. For example, the operation
of a few of our significant games, including 
 and 
 , was interrupted for several hours in April 2011 due to a network outage. If a particular game is unavailable when players attempt to access it or navigation through
a game is slower than they expect, players may stop playing the game and may be less likely to return to the game as often, if at all. A failure or significant interruption in our game service would harm our reputation and operations. We expect to
continue to make significant investments to our technology infrastructure to maintain and improve all aspects of player experience and game performance. To the extent that our disaster recovery systems are not adequate, or we do not effectively
address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate increasing traffic, our business and operating results may suffer. We do not maintain insurance policies
covering losses relating to our systems and we do not have business interruption insurance.

 Security breaches, computer viruses and
computer hacking attacks could harm our business and results of operations. 
 Security breaches, computer malware and
computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future. Any security breach caused by hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to
information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm our business, financial condition and
operating results. We have experienced and will continue to experience hacking attacks. Because of our prominence in the social game industry, we believe we are a particularly attractive target for hackers. Though it is difficult to determine what
harm may directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our players may harm our reputation and our ability
to retain existing players and attract new players. 
 If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and operating results could be harmed. 
 We continue to experience rapid growth in our headcount and operations, which will continue to place significant
demands on our management and our operational, financial and technological infrastructure. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 54% of our employees had been with us for less than one year and approximately 84% for less than two years. As we
continue to grow, we must expend significant resources to identify, hire, integrate, develop and motivate a large number of qualified employees. If we fail to effectively manage our hiring needs and successfully integrate our new hires, our ability
to continue launching new games and enhance existing games could suffer. 
 To effectively manage the growth of our business and
operations, we will need to continue spending significant resources to improve our technology infrastructure, our operational, financial and management controls, and our reporting systems and procedures by, among other things: 
 monitoring and updating our technology infrastructure to maintain high performance and minimize down time; 
 enhancing information and communication systems to ensure that our employees and offices around the world are well-coordinated and can effectively
communicate with each other; 
 enhancing our internal controls to ensure timely and accurate reporting of all of our operations; and 
 appropriately documenting our information technology systems and our business processes. 
 These enhancements and improvements will require significant capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee
resources. If we fail to implement these enhancements and improvements effectively, our ability to manage our expected growth and comply with the rules and regulations that are applicable to public reporting companies will be impaired. In addition,
if our operating costs are higher than we expect or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses, our operating results will suffer. 
 Our growth prospects will suffer if we are unable to continue to develop successful games for mobile platforms. 
 Developing games for mobile platforms is an important component of our strategy. We have devoted and we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to the development of our mobile games, and we
cannot guarantee that we will continue to develop such games that appeal to players or advertisers. The uncertainties we face include: 
 we have relatively limited experience working with wireless carriers, mobile platform providers and other partners whose cooperation we may need in
order to be successful; 
 we may encounter difficulty in integrating features on games developed for mobile platforms that a sufficient number of players will pay for; and 
 we will need to move beyond payment methods provided by social networks and successfully allow for a variety of payment methods and systems based on
the mobile platform, geographies and other factors. 
 These and other uncertainties make it difficult to know
whether we will succeed in continuing to develop commercially viable games for mobile. If we do not succeed in doing so, our growth prospects will suffer. 
 Our core values of focusing on our players first and acting for the long term may conflict with the short-term interests of our business. 
 One of our core values is to focus on surprising and delighting our players, which we believe is essential to our success and serves the
best, long-term interests of Zynga and our stakeholders. Therefore, we have made in the past and we may make in the future, significant investments or changes in strategy that we think will benefit 
 our players, even if our decision negatively impacts our operating results in the short term. For example, in late 2009 and in 2010 we reduced in-game advertising offers in order to improve
player experience. This decrease in in-game offers led to a reduction of advertising revenue in 2010 as compared to 2009. Our decisions may not result in the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case the success of our games, business and
operating results could be harmed. 
 If we lose the services of our founder and Chief Executive Officer or other members of our senior
management team, we may not be able to execute our business strategy. 
 Our success depends in a large part upon the
continued service of our senior management team. In particular, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Pincus, is critical to our vision, strategic direction, culture, products and technology. We do not maintain key-man insurance for
Mr. Pincus or any other member of our senior management team. The loss of our founder and Chief Executive Officer, even temporarily, or any other member of senior management would harm our business. 
 If we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified employees, we may not be able to grow effectively. 
 Our ability to compete and grow depends in large part on the efforts and talents of our employees. Such employees, particularly game
designers, product managers and engineers, are in high demand, and we devote significant resources to identifying, hiring, training, successfully integrating and retaining these employees. We have historically hired a number of key personnel through
acquisitions, and as competition with several other game companies increases, we may incur significant expenses in continuing this practice. The loss of employees or the inability to hire additional skilled employees as necessary could result in
significant disruptions to our business, and the integration of replacement personnel could be time-consuming and expensive and cause additional disruptions to our business. 
 We believe that two critical components of our success and our ability to retain our best people are our culture and our competitive compensation practices. As we continue to grow rapidly, and we develop
the infrastructure of a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain our entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture. In addition, many of our employees may be able to receive significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public
markets, which may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. Moreover, there may also be disparities of wealth between those of our employees whom we hired prior to our initial public offering in December 2011 and those who joined us after
we became a public company, which may harm our culture and relations among employees. 
 An increasing number of individuals are utilizing
devices other than personal computers to access the Internet, and versions of our games developed for these devices might not gain widespread adoption, or may not function as intended. 
 The number of individuals who access the Internet through devices other than a personal computer, such as smartphones, tablets,
televisions and set-top box devices, has increased dramatically, and we believe this trend is likely to continue. The generally lower processing speed, power, functionality and memory associated with these devices make playing our games through such
devices more difficult; and the versions of our games developed for these devices may not be compelling to players. In addition, each device manufacturer or platform provider may establish unique or restrictive terms and conditions for developers on
such devices or platforms, and our games may not work well or be viewable on these devices as a result. We have limited experience in developing and optimizing versions of our games for players on alternative devices and platforms. To expand our
business, we will need to support a number of alternative devices and technologies. Once developed, we may choose to port or convert a game into separate versions for alternative devices with different technological requirements. As new devices and
new mobile platforms or updates to platforms are continually being released, we may encounter problems in developing versions of our games for use on these alternative devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support,
and maintenance of such devices and platforms. If we are 
 unable to successfully expand the platforms and devices on which our games are available, or if the versions of our games that we create for alternative platforms and devices are not compelling
to our players, our business will suffer. 
 Expansion into international markets is important for our growth, and as we expand
internationally, we will face additional business, political, regulatory, operational, financial and economic risks, any of which could increase our costs and hinder such growth. 
 Continuing to expand our business to attract players in countries other than the United States is a critical element of our business
strategy. An important part of targeting international markets is developing offerings that are localized and customized for the players in those markets. We have a limited operating history as a company outside of the United States. We expect to
continue to devote significant resources to international expansion through acquisitions, the establishment of additional offices and development studios, and increasing our foreign language offerings. Our ability to expand our business and to
attract talented employees and players in an increasing number of international markets will require considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an
environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems, regulatory systems and commercial infrastructures. We have experienced difficulties in the past and have not been successful in all the countries we
have entered. Expanding our international focus may subject us to risks that we have not faced before or increase risks that we currently face, including risks associated with: 
 recruiting and retaining talented and capable management and employees in foreign countries; 
 challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences; 
 developing and customizing games and other offerings that appeal to the tastes and preferences of players in international markets; 
 competition from local game makers with significant market share in those markets and with a better understanding of player preferences; 
 protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights; 
 negotiating agreements with local distribution platforms that are sufficiently economically beneficial to us and protective of our rights; 
 the inability to extend proprietary rights in our brand, content or technology into new jurisdictions; 
 implementing alternative payment methods for virtual goods in a manner that complies with local laws and practices and protects us from fraud; 
 compliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations, including privacy laws and laws relating to content; 
 compliance with anti-bribery laws including without limitation, compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; 
 credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud; 
 currency exchange rate fluctuations; 
 protectionist laws and business practices that favor local businesses in some countries; 
 foreign tax consequences; 
 foreign exchange controls or U.S. tax restrictions that might restrict or prevent us from repatriating income earned in countries outside the United
States; 
 political, economic and social instability; 
 higher costs associated with doing business internationally; 
 export or import regulations; and 
 trade and tariff restrictions. 
 Entering new international markets will be expensive, our ability to successfully gain market acceptance in any particular market is uncertain, and the distraction of our senior management team could harm
our business. 
 Competition within the broader entertainment industry is intense and our existing and potential players may be attracted
to competing forms of entertainment such as offline and traditional online games, television, movies and sports, as well as other entertainment options on the Internet. 
 Our players face a vast array of entertainment choices. Other forms of entertainment, such as offline, traditional online, personal computer and console games, television, movies, sports and the Internet,
are much larger and more well-established markets and may be perceived by our players to offer greater variety, affordability, interactivity and enjoyment. These other forms of entertainment compete for the discretionary time and income of our
players. If we are unable to sustain sufficient interest in our games in comparison to other forms of entertainment, including new forms of entertainment, our business model may no longer be viable. 
 There are low barriers to entry in the social game industry, and competition is intense. 
 The social game industry is highly competitive, with low barriers to entry and we expect more companies to enter the sector and a wider
range of social games to be introduced. Our competitors that develop social games for social networks vary in size and include publicly-traded companies such as Electronic Arts Inc. and The Walt Disney Company and privately-held companies such as
Crowdstar, Inc., Vostu, Ltd. and wooga GmbH. In addition, online game developers and distributors who are primarily focused on specific international markets, such as Tencent Holdings Limited in Asia, and high-profile companies with significant
online presences that to date have not developed social games, such as Amazon.com, Facebook, Google Inc., Microsoft Corporation and Yahoo! Inc., may decide to develop social games. Some of these current and potential competitors have significant
resources for developing or acquiring additional games, may be able to incorporate their own strong brands and assets into their games, have a more diversified set of revenue sources than we do and may be less severely affected by changes in
consumer preferences, regulations or other developments that may impact the online social game industry. In addition, we have limited experience in developing games for mobile and other platforms and our ability to succeed on those platforms is
uncertain. As we continue to devote significant resources to developing games for those platforms, we will face significant competition from established companies, including Electronic Arts Inc., DeNA Co. Ltd., Gameloft SA, Glu Mobile Inc. and Rovio
Mobile Ltd. We expect new mobile-game competitors to enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources to develop and market competing games and applications. 
 The value of our virtual goods is highly dependent on how we manage the economies in our games. If we fail to manage our game economies properly, our business may suffer. 
 Paying players purchase virtual goods in our games because of the perceived value of these goods which is dependent on the relative ease
of securing an equivalent good via non-paid means within the game. The perceived value of these virtual goods can be impacted by an increase in the availability of free or discounted Facebook Credits or by various actions that we take in the games
including offering discounts for virtual goods, giving away virtual goods in promotions or providing easier non-paid means to secure these goods. If we fail to manage our virtual economies properly, players may be less likely to purchase virtual
goods and our business may suffer. 
 Some of our players may make sales and/or purchases of virtual goods used in our games through
unauthorized third-party websites, which may impede our revenue growth. 
 Some of our players may make sales and/or
purchases of our virtual goods, such as 
 virtual poker chips, through unauthorized third-party sellers in exchange for real currency. These unauthorized transactions are usually arranged on third-party websites. We do not generate
any revenue from these transactions. Accordingly, these unauthorized purchases and sales from third-party sellers could impede our revenue and profit growth by, among other things: 
 Zynga Poker 
 decreasing revenue from authorized transactions; 
 downward pressure on the prices we charge players for our virtual currency and virtual goods; 
 lost revenue from paying players who stop playing a particular game; 
 costs we incur to develop technological measures to curtail unauthorized transactions; 
 legal claims relating to the diminution of value of our virtual goods; and 
 increased customer support costs to respond to dissatisfied players. 
 To discourage unauthorized purchases and sales of our virtual goods, we have stated in our terms of service that the buying or selling of
virtual currency and virtual goods from unauthorized third-party sellers may result in bans from our games and/or legal action. We have banned players as a result of such activities. We have also developed technological measures to help detect
unauthorized transactions. If we decide to implement further restrictions on players ability to transfer virtual goods, we may lose players, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations. 
 The proliferation of cheating programs and scam offers that seek to exploit our games and players affects the game-playing experience
and may lead players to stop playing our games. 
 Unrelated third parties have developed, and may continue to develop,
cheating programs that enable players to exploit our games, play them in an automated way or obtain unfair advantages over other players who do play fairly. These programs harm the experience of players who play fairly and may disrupt
the virtual economy of our games. In addition, unrelated third parties attempt to scam our players with fake offers for virtual goods. We devote significant resources to discover and disable these programs and activities, and if we are unable to do
so quickly our operations may be disrupted, our reputation damaged and players may stop playing our games. This may lead to lost revenue from paying players, increased cost of developing technological measures to combat these programs and
activities, legal claims relating to the diminution in value of our virtual currency and goods, and increased customer service costs needed to respond to dissatisfied players. 
 Our quarterly operating results are volatile and difficult to predict. 
 Our bookings, revenue, traffic and operating results could vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year and may fail to match our past performance or the expectations of securities analysis
or investors because of a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control. Factors that may contribute to the variability of our operating results include the risk factors listed in these Risk Factors and the factors
discussed in the section titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Factors Affecting Our Performance. 
 In particular, we recognize revenue from sale of our virtual goods in accordance with GAAP, which is complex and based on our assumptions
and historical data with respect to the sale and use of various types of virtual goods. In the event that such assumptions are revised based on new data or there are changes in the historical mix of virtual goods sold due to new game
introductions, reduced virtual good sales in existing games or other factors or there are changes in our estimates of average playing periods, the amount of revenue that we recognize in any particular period may fluctuate significantly. For further
information regarding our revenue recognition policy, see the section titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting PoliciesRevenue Recognition. 
 Given our short operating history and the rapidly evolving social game industry, our
historical operating results may not be useful in predicting our future operating results. In addition, metrics we have developed or those available from third parties regarding our industry and the performance of our games, including DAUs, MAUs,
MUUs and ABPU may not be indicative of our financial performance. 
 Failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or the
costs involved in such enforcement could harm our business and operating results. 
 We regard the protection of our
trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, domain names and other product rights as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual
restrictions. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our
proprietary information. However, these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information or deter independent development of similar
technologies by others. 
 We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States
and in certain locations outside the United States. We are seeking to protect our trademarks, patents and domain names in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful or which we may
not pursue in every location. We may, over time, increase our investment in protecting our innovations through increased patent filings that are expensive and time-consuming and may not result in issued patents that can be effectively enforced. The
Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the Leahy-Smith Act), was adopted in September 2011. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent
applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The United States Patent and Trademark Office is currently developing regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive
changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act will not become effective until up to 18 months after its enactment. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business.
However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could harm our business. 
 Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity
and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs, adverse publicity or diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely
affect our business and operating results. If we fail to maintain, protect and enhance our intellectual property rights, our business and operating results may be harmed. 
 We are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly to defend and could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain
technologies in the future. 
 From time to time, we have faced, and we expect to face in the future, allegations that we
have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including from our competitors, non-practicing entities and former employers of our personnel. Patent and other intellectual property
litigation may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict. As the result of any court judgment or settlement we may be obligated to cancel the launch of a new game, stop offering a game or certain features of a game, pay
royalties or significant settlement costs, purchase licenses or modify our games and features while we develop substitutes. 
 In addition, we use open source software in our games and expect to continue to use open source software in the future. From time to
time, we may face claims from companies that incorporate open source software into 
 their products, claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the source code, the open source software and/or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to
enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our games, any of which
would have a negative effect on our business and operating results. 
 Although we do not believe that the final outcome of
litigation and claims that we currently face will have a material adverse effect on our business, our expectations may not prove to be correct. Even if these matters do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant
cash settlements, these matters, and the time and resources necessary to litigate or resolve them, could harm our business, operating results, financial condition, reputation or the market price of our Class A common stock. 
 Programming errors or flaws in our games could harm our reputation or decrease market acceptance of our games, which would harm our operating
results. 
 Our games may contain errors, bugs, flaws or corrupted data, and these defects may only become apparent after
their launch, particularly as we launch new games and rapidly release new features to existing games under tight time constraints. We believe that if our players have a negative experience with our games, they may be less inclined to continue or
resume playing our games or recommend our games to other potential players. Undetected programming errors, game defects and data corruption can disrupt our operations, adversely affect the game experience of our players by allowing players to gain
unfair advantage, harm our reputation, cause our players to stop playing our games, divert our resources and delay market acceptance of our games, any of which could result in legal liability to us or harm our operating results. 
 Evolving regulations concerning data privacy may result in increased regulation and different industry standards, which could prevent us from
providing our current games to our players, or require us to modify our games, thereby harming our business. 
 The
regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Practices regarding the collection, use, storage, transmission and security of personal information by companies operating
over the Internet and mobile platforms have recently come under increased public scrutiny, and civil claims alleging liability for the breach of data privacy have been asserted against us. The U.S. government, including the Federal Trade Commission
and the Department of Commerce, has announced that it is reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection of information concerning consumer behavior on the Internet, including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising
practices. In addition, the European Union is in the process of proposing reforms to its existing data protection legal framework, which may result in a greater compliance burden for companies with users in Europe. Various government and consumer
agencies have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices. 
 We began operations in 2007 and have grown
rapidly. While our administrative systems have developed rapidly, during our earlier history our practices relating to intellectual property, data privacy and security, and legal compliance may not have been as robust as they are now, and there may
be unasserted claims arising from this period that we are not able to anticipate. In addition, our business, including our ability to operate and expand internationally, could be adversely affected if laws or regulations are adopted, interpreted, or
implemented in a manner that is inconsistent with our current business practices and that require changes to these practices, the design of our website, games, features or our privacy policy. In particular, the success of our business has been, and
we expect will continue to be, driven by our ability to responsibly use the data that our players share with us. Therefore, our business could be harmed by any significant change to applicable laws, regulations or industry practices regarding the
use or disclosure of data our players choose to share with us, or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of consumers for such use and disclosure is obtained. Such changes may require us to modify our games and features,
possibly in a material manner, and may limit our ability to develop new games and features that make use of the data that our players voluntarily share with us. 
 We process, store and use personal information and other data, which subjects us to governmental
regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business. 
 We receive, store and process personal information and other player data, and we enable our players to share their personal information with each other and with third parties, including on the Internet
and mobile platforms. There are numerous federal, state and local laws around the world regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other player data on the Internet and mobile
platforms, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules. We generally comply with industry standards and are subject to the terms of our own privacy
policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties (including voluntary third-party certification bodies such as TRUSTe). We strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and certain industry codes of conduct relating
to privacy and data protection, to the extent reasonably attainable. However, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or
our practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to players or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the
unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other player data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our
players to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as players, vendors or developers, violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put our
players information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. 
 In the area of information
security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to players when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to Californias Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of
minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement. The costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on
our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities. 
 Our business is subject to a variety of other U.S. and
foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business. 
 We are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad, including laws regarding consumer protection, intellectual property, export and national security, that are continuously evolving and
developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly laws outside the United States. For example, laws relating to the liability of providers of online
services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other
theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted or the content provided by users. It is also likely that as our business grows and evolves and our games are played in a greater number of countries, we will become
subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions. We are potentially subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect the offering of certain types of content, such as that which depicts violence, many of which
are ambiguous, still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business or expose us to liability. In addition, certain of our games, including 
 , may become subject to gambling-related rules and regulations and
expose us to civil and criminal penalties if we do not comply. It is difficult to predict how existing laws will be applied to our business and the new laws to which we may become subject. See the discussion included in the section titled
Business  Government Regulation.

 If we are not able to comply with these laws or regulations or if we
become liable under these laws or regulations, we could be directly harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our 
 exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to modify our games, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition,
the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm
our business and operating results. 
 It is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or construed to apply
to us in the United States and elsewhere that could restrict the online and mobile industries, including player privacy, advertising, taxation, content suitability, copyright, distribution and antitrust. Furthermore, the growth and development of
electronic commerce and virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours conducting business through the Internet and mobile devices. We anticipate that scrutiny
and regulation of our industry will increase and we will be required to devote legal and other resources to addressing such regulation. For example, existing laws or new laws regarding the regulation of currency and banking institutions may be
interpreted to cover virtual currency or goods. If that were to occur we may be required to seek licenses, authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators, the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other
requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight, all of which could significantly increase our operating costs. Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the United States or
elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of social game services and impair our business. 
 Companies and governmental
agencies may restrict access to Facebook, our website or the Internet generally, which could lead to the loss or slower growth of our player base. 
 Our players need to access the Internet and in particular Facebook and our website to play our games. Companies and governmental agencies, could block access to Facebook, our website or the Internet
generally for a number of reasons such as security or confidentiality concerns or regulatory reasons, or they may adopt policies that prohibit employees from accessing Facebook, our website or other social platforms. For example, the government of
the Peoples Republic of China has blocked access to Facebook in China. If companies or governmental entities block or limit access to Facebook or our website or otherwise adopt policies restricting players from playing our games our business
could be negatively impacted and could lead to the loss or slower growth of our player base. 
 Our business will suffer if we are unable
to successfully integrate acquired companies into our business or otherwise manage the growth associated with multiple acquisitions. 
 We have acquired businesses, personnel and technologies in the past and we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions that are complementary to our existing business and expand our employee base and the
breadth of our offerings. Our ability to grow through future acquisitions will depend on the availability of suitable acquisition and investment candidates at an acceptable cost, our ability to compete effectively to attract these candidates and the
availability of financing to complete larger acquisitions. Since we expect the social game industry to consolidate in the future, we may face significant competition in executing our growth strategy. Future acquisitions or investments could result
in potential dilutive issuances of equity securities, use of significant cash balances or incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could adversely affect our
financial condition and results of operations. The benefits of an acquisition or investment may also take considerable time to develop, and we cannot be certain that any particular acquisition or investment will produce the intended benefits. 
 Integration of a new companys operations, assets and personnel into ours will require significant attention from our
management. The diversion of our managements attention away from our business and any difficulties encountered in the integration process could harm our ability to manage our business. Future acquisitions will also expose us to potential
risks, including risks associated with any acquired liabilities, the integration of new operations, technologies and personnel, unforeseen or hidden liabilities and unanticipated, information security 
 vulnerabilities, the diversion of resources from our existing businesses, sites and technologies, the inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset the costs and expenses of acquisitions,
and potential loss of, or harm to, our relationships with employees, players and other suppliers as a result of integration of new businesses. 
 Failure in our pursuit or execution of new business initiatives could have a material adverse impact on our business. 
 Our growth strategy includes evaluating, considering and executing new business initiatives. Executing on new businesses initiatives can
be a difficult task. Although management attempts to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular new initiative, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all such risks or that subsequent events will not alter the risks
that we perceive at the time we decide to pursue any new business initiative. New initiatives may also divert our managements attention from other business issues and opportunities. Any negative events or results that may arise as we pursue
new business initiatives may adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates will affect our financial results, which we report in U.S. dollars. 
 As we continue to
expand our international operations, we become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We incur expenses for employee compensation and other operating expenses at our non-U.S. locations in the local currency, and an
increasing percentage of our international revenue is from players who pay us in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies could result in the dollar equivalent of
such expenses being higher and/or the dollar equivalent of such foreign-denominated revenue being lower than would be the case if exchange rates were stable. This could have a negative impact on our reported operating results. 
 The enactment of legislation implementing changes in the U.S. taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform
policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. 
 The current administration has made
public statements indicating that it has made international tax reform a priority, and key members of the U.S. Congress have conducted hearings and proposed new legislation. Recent changes to U.S. tax laws, including limitations on the ability of
taxpayers to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and the deferral of certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the United States are repatriated to the United States, as well as changes to U.S. tax laws that may be enacted in the future,
could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. Due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our
financial position and results of operations. 
 A change in the application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions could result in an
increase to our worldwide effective tax rate and a change in how we operate our business. 
 Our corporate structure and
intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we develop and use our intellectual property and the transfer pricing of our intercompany transactions, are intended to provide us worldwide tax efficiencies. The application of the tax laws
of various jurisdictions, including the United States, to our international business activities is subject to interpretation and depends on our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany
arrangements. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, including our transfer pricing, or determine that the manner in which we
operate our business is not consistent with the manner in which we report our income to the jurisdictions, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. 
 Our facilities are located near known earthquake fault zones, and the occurrence of an earthquake or
other natural disaster could cause damage to our facilities and equipment, which could require us to curtail or cease operations. 
 Our principal offices and network operations centers are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, an area known for earthquakes, and are thus vulnerable to damage. We are also vulnerable to damage from
other types of disasters, including power loss, fire, explosions, floods, communications failures, terrorist attacks and similar events. If any disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business at our facilities could be impaired. 
 We may require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and support business growth, and this capital might not be
available on acceptable terms or at all. 
 We intend to continue to make significant investments to support our business
growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new games and features or enhance our existing games, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses, personnel and
technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer
significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. Any debt financing that we secure in the future could involve restrictive
covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We may not
be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to
respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be harmed. 
 Risks Related to Our Class A Common
Stock 
 The three class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held
our stock prior to our initial public offering, including our founder and Chief Executive Officer and our other executive officers, employees and directors and their affiliates; this limits our other stockholders ability to influence corporate
matters. 
 Our Class C common stock has 70 votes per share, our Class B common stock has seven votes per share and our
Class A common stock has one vote per share. The holders of Class B common stock and Class C common stock, including our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Pincus, and our other executive officers, employees and directors and their
affiliates, collectively hold approximately 97.8% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Mr. Pincus beneficially owns approximately 36.0% of the total voting power of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, Mr. Pincus
and the other holders of our Class B common stock will continue to have significant influence over the management and affairs of the company and control over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant
corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. 
 Future
transfers or sales by holders of Class B common stock or Class C common stock will result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those stockholders
who retain their existing shares of Class B or Class C common stock. In addition, as shares of Class B common stock are transferred or sold and converted to Class A common stock, the sole holder of Class C common stock, Mr. Pincus, will
have greater relative voting control to the extent he retains his existing shares of Class C common stock, and as a result he could in the future control a majority of our total voting power. Mr. Pincus is entitled to vote his shares in his own
interests and may do so. 
 Certain provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could limit attempts by our
stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors or current management and limit the market price of our Class A common stock. 
 Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in our board of directors or management. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include
provisions that: 
 establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for
election to our board of directors; 
 prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors; and 
 reflect three classes of common stock, as discussed above. 
 These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of
directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally
prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested
stockholder. 
 Our share price has been and will likely continue to be volatile. 
 The trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and could be subject to wide
fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Since shares of our Class A common stock were sold in our initial public offering in December 2011 at a price of $10.00 per share, our stock price has ranged
from $7.97 to $14.35, through February 22, 2012. In addition to the factors discussed in these Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, factors that may cause volatility in our share price include: 
 changes in projected operational and financial results; 
 issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts; 
 market rumors or press reports; 
 the use by investors or analysts of third-party data regarding our business that may not reflect our actual performance; 
 the expiration of contractual lock-up agreements; 
 fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us; 
 fluctuations in the trading volume of our shares, or the size of our public float relative to the total number of shares of our Class A, Class B
and Class C common stock that are issued and outstanding; 
 share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares; and 
 general economic and market conditions. 
 Furthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations
often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and 
 industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the
market price of our Class A common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the
future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our managements attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business. 
 Our Class A common stock price may be volatile due to third-party data regarding our games. 
 Third parties, such as AppData, publish daily data about us and other social game companies with respect to DAUs and MAUs and other information concerning social game usage, in particular on Facebook.
These metrics can be volatile, particularly for specific games, and in many cases do not accurately reflect the actual levels of usage of our games across all platforms and may not correlate to our bookings or revenue from the sale of virtual goods.
There is a possibility that third parties could change their methodologies for calculating these metrics in the future. To the extent that securities analysts or investors base their views of our business or prospects on such third-party data, the
price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and may not reflect the performance of our business. 
 If securities or industry
analysts do not publish research about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline. 
 The trading market for our Class A common stock, to some extent, depends on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about our business. We do not have any control over
these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish
reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. 
 Future sales or potential sales of our Class A common stock in the public market could cause our share price to decline. 
 We have a small public float relative to the total number of shares of our Class A, Class B and Class C common stock that are issued
and outstanding and a substantial majority of our issued and outstanding shares are currently restricted as a result of securities laws, lock-up agreements or other contractual restrictions that restrict transfers. 
 Upon completion of the release of the underwriters lockup from our initial public offering, currently scheduled to expire on
May 28, 2012, approximately 687.9 million shares will be eligible for sale upon the expiration of lock-up agreements, subject in some cases to volume and other restrictions of Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended. In addition, the holders of 363,241,145 shares of Class B common stock, or 50.34% of our total outstanding common stock, based on shares outstanding as of December 31, 2011, will be entitled to rights with respect to registration of
these shares under the Securities Act pursuant to an investors rights agreement. If these holders of our Class B common stock, by exercising their registration rights, sell a large number of shares, they could adversely affect the market price
for our Class A common stock. If we file a registration statement for the purposes of selling additional shares to raise capital and are required to include shares held by these holders pursuant to the exercise of their registration rights, our
ability to raise capital may be impaired. Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public market following the release of the lock-up or otherwise, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market
price of our Class A common stock to decline. 
 If we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the
future, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected. 
 If we are unable to maintain
adequate internal controls for financial reporting in the future, or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls as required pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, investor confidence in the
accuracy of our financial reports may be impacted or the market price of our Class A common stock could be negatively impacted. 
 The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert managements attention and affect our ability to attract and
retain qualified board members. 
 We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Select Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased
and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file
annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. 
 We also expect that being a public
company, subject to these rules and regulations, will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These
factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers. 
 As a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more
visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be harmed, and even if the claims do not result in
litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and harm our business and operating results. 
 We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. 
 We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings
for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A
common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.
